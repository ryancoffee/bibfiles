DNA undergoes conformational and topological changes during many cellular processes such as replication and transcription. Topoisomerases have prob­ ably evolved to solve these conformational and topological changes in DNA. Two types of topoisomerases have been isolated from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. They perform their functions by introducing transient pro­ tein-bridged DNA breaks on one (type I) or both DNA strands (type II)
