abstract = {A method for the direct measurement of the γ-resonance width for nuclei with excitation energies E0 ≤ 100 keV and lifetimes τ ≥ 1 s is discussed. Instead of scanning the energy, as is conventional in Mössbauer spectroscopy, it is proposed to measure the time behaviour of the spontaneous coherent emission of γ-quanta by a nuclear ensemble after the cutoff of the exciting radiation flux.}
