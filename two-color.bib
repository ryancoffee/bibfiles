abstract = {Few-cycle laser pulses with wavelengths centered at 400 nm and 800 nm are simultaneously obtained through wavelength separation of ultrashort, spectrally broadened Vis--NIR laser pulses spanning 350--1100 nm wavelengths. The 400 nm and 800 nm pulses are separately compressed, yielding pulses with 4.4 fs and 3.8 fs duration, respectively. The pulse energy exceeds 5 $\mu$J for the 400 nm pulses and 750 $\mu$J for the 800 nm pulses. Intense 400 nm few-cycle pulses have a broad range of applications in nonlinear optical spectroscopy, which include the study of photochemical dynamics, semiconductors, and photovoltaic materials on few-femtosecond to attosecond time scales. The ultrashort 400 nm few-cycle pulses generated here not only extend the spectral range of the optical pulse for NIR--XUV attosecond pump--probe spectroscopy but also pave the way for two-color, three-pulse, multidimensional optical--XUV spectroscopy experiments.},
