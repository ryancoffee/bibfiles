	abstract {The time–energy information of ultrashort X-ray free-electron laser pulses generated by the Linac Coherent Light Source is measured with attosecond resolution via angular streaking of neon 1s photoelectrons. The X-ray pulses promote electrons from the neon core level into an ionization continuum, where they are dressed with the electric field of a circularly polarized infrared laser. This induces characteristic modulations of the resulting photoelectron energy and angular distribution. From these modulations we recover the single-shot attosecond intensity structure and chirp of arbitrary X-ray pulses based on self-amplified spontaneous emission, which have eluded direct measurement so far. We characterize individual attosecond pulses, including their instantaneous frequency, and identify double pulses with well-defined delays and spectral properties, thus paving the way for X-ray pump/X-ray probe attosecond free-electron laser science.}

abstract = {We present a reconstruction algorithm for isolated attosecond pulses, which exploits the phase dependent energy modulation of a photoelectron ionized in the presence of a strong laser field. The energy modulation due to a circularly polarized laser field is manifest strongly in the angle-resolved photoelectron momentum distribution, allowing for complete reconstruction of the temporal and spectral profile of an attosecond burst. We show that this type of reconstruction algorithm is robust against counting noise and suitable for single-shot experiments. This algorithm holds potential for a variety of applications for attosecond pulse sources.}

	abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers are unique sources of high-brightness coherent radiation. However, existing devices supply only linearly polarized light, precluding studies of chiral dynamics. A device called the Delta undulator has been installed at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) to provide tunable polarization. With a reverse tapered planar undulator line to pre-microbunch the beam and the novel technique of beam diverting, hundreds of microjoules of circularly polarized X-ray pulses are produced at 500–1,200 eV. These X-ray pulses are tens of femtoseconds long, have a degree of circular polarization of 0.98–0.04+0.02 at 707 eV and may be scanned in energy. We also present a new two-colour X-ray pump–X-ray probe operating mode for the LCLS. Energy differences of ΔE/E = 2.4\% are supported, and the second pulse can be adjusted to any elliptical polarization. In this mode, the pointing, timing, intensity and wavelength of the two pulses can be modified.}

AB  - The X-ray free-electron laser has opened a new era for photon science, improving the X-ray brightness by ten orders of magnitude over previously available sources. Similar to an optical laser, the spectral and temporal structure of the radiation pulses can be tailored to the specific needs of many experiments by accurately manipulating the lasing medium, that is, the electron beam. Here we report the generation of mJ-level two-colour hard X-ray pulses of few femtoseconds duration with an XFEL driven by twin electron bunches at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This performance represents an improvement of over an order of magnitude in peak power over state-of-the-art two-colour XFELs. The unprecedented intensity and temporal coherence of this new two-colour X-ray free-electron laser enable an entirely new set of scientific applications, ranging from X-ray pump/X-ray probe experiments to the imaging of complex biological samples with multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion.

abstract={Here we present the first angle-resolved, non-resonant (normal) Auger spectra for impulsively aligned nitrogen molecules. We have measured the angular pattern of Auger electron emission following K -shell photoionization by 1.1 keV photons from the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Using strong-field-induced molecular alignment to make molecular frame measurements is equally effective for both repulsive and quasi-bound final states. The capability to resolve Auger emission angular distributions in the molecular frame of reference provides a new tool for spectral assignments in congested Auger electron spectra that takes advantage of the symmetries of the final diction states. Based on our experimental results and theoretical predictions, we propose the assignment of the spectral features in the Auger electron spectrum.}

	abstract={Two-color, single-shot time-of-flight electron spectroscopy of atomic neon was employed at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) to measure laser-assisted Auger decay in the x-ray regime. This x-ray-optical cross-correlation technique provides a straightforward, non-invasive and on-line means of determining the duration of femtosecond (>40 fs) x-ray pulses. In combination with a theoretical model of the process based on the soft-photon approximation, we were able to obtain the LCLS pulse duration and to extract a mean value of the temporal jitter between the optical pulses from a synchronized Ti-sapphire laser and x-ray pulses from the LCLS. We find that the experimentally determined values are systematically smaller than the length of the electron bunches. Nominal electron pulse durations of 175 and 75 fs, as provided by the LCLS control system, yield x-ray pulse shapes of 120±20 fs full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and an upper limit of 40±20 fs FWHM, respectively. Simulations of the free-electron laser agree well with the experimental results.}

An ultra-short x-ray pulse photo-ionizes a semiconductor (Si3N4) membrane and changes the optical transmission. An optical continuum pulse with a temporally chirped bandwidth spanning 630 nm -- 710 nm interacts with the membrane such that the timing of the x-ray pulse can be determined from the onset of the spectral modulation of the transmitted optical pulse. This experiment demonstrates a nearly in situ single-shot measurement of the x-ray pulse arrival time relative to the ultra-short optical pulse.}

We employ eight equally spaced ultrafast laser pulses with a separation that takes advantage of the periodic revivals for the ensemble of quantum rotors. Each successive pulse increases the transient alignment [<$\cos^2 \theta$>(t)] and also moves the rotational population away from thermal equilibrium. These measurements are combined with simulations to determine the value of <$\cos^2 \theta$>, the J-state distributions, and the functional dependencies of the alignment features.}"

%abstract = "{Using pump-probe spectroscopy with ultrashort laser pulses, we see an enhancement of the charge-asymmetric dissociation (CAD) channel, $I_2^{2+}\rightarrow I^{2+) + I$, over a narrow range of internuclear separation, in addition to the previously studied enhanced ionization of this species. 
%The enhancement of the CAD channel appears to come from excitation of the symmetric ground state dissociation channel $(I^+ + I^+)$ for two reasons: there is a depletion in the symmetric channel at approximately the same pump-probe delay as the asymmetric enhancement, and the symmetric channel decreases while the asymmetric channel increases as a function of probe intensity at a fixed delay.
%In addition, we find that the kinetic energies of the of the extra I2+ + I ions decrease for increasing delay.
%A more complete understanding of these observations depends strongly on the little known potential energy curves of the various charge states of $I_2$. Thus, we use model potential curves to explain the delay dependence of the kinetic energy release. The excitation appears to be produced by a resonant 3-photon transition within I$_2^{2+}$ rather than by ionization of I$_2^+$.}"
