title = {Coincidence anomaly detection for unsupervised locating of edge localized modes in the DIII-D tokamak dataset},
journal = {Machine Learning: Science and Technology},
abstract = {Using supervised learning to train a machine learning model to predict an on-coming edge localized mode (ELM) requires a large number of labeled samples. Creating an appropriate data set from the very large database of discharges at a long-running tokamak, such as DIII-D, would be a very time-consuming process for a human. Considering this need and difficulty, we use coincidence anomaly detection, an unsupervised learning technique, to train an ELM-identifier to identify and label ELMs in the DIII-D discharge database. This ELM-identifier shows, simultaneously, a precision of 0.68 and a recall of 0.63 (AUC is 0.73) on identifying ELMs in example time series pulled from thousands of discharges spanning five years. In a test set of 50 discharges, the algorithm finds over 26 thousand ELM candidates, more than 5 times the existing catalog of ELMs labeled by humans.}

title = {Real-time confinement regime detection in fusion plasmas with convolutional neural networks and high-bandwidth edge fluctuation measurements},
journal = {Machine Learning: Science and Technology},
abstract = {A real-time detection of the plasma confinement regime can enable new advanced plasma control capabilities for both the access to and sustainment of enhanced confinement regimes in fusion devices. For example, a real-time indication of the confinement regime can facilitate transition to the high-performing wide-pedestal (WP) quiescent H-mode, or avoid unwanted transitions to lower confinement regimes that may induce plasma termination. To demonstrate real-time confinement regime detection, we use the 2D beam emission spectroscopy (BES) diagnostic system to capture localized density fluctuations of long wavelength turbulent modes in the edge region at a 1 MHz sampling rate. BES data from 330 discharges in either L-mode, H-mode, quiescent H (QH)-mode, or WP QH-mode were collected from the DIII-D tokamak and curated to develop a high-quality database to train a deep-learning classification model for real-time confinement detection. We utilize the 6×8 spatial configuration with a time window of 1024 µs and recast the input to obtain spectral-like features via fast Fourier transform preprocessing. We employ a shallow 3D convolutional neural network for the multivariate time-series classification task and utilize a softmax in the final dense layer to retrieve a probability distribution over the different confinement regimes. Our model classifies the global confinement state on 44 unseen test discharges with an average F 1 score of 0.94, using only ∼1 ms snippets of BES data at a time. This activity demonstrates the feasibility for real-time data analysis of fluctuation diagnostics in future devices such as ITER, where the need for reliable and advanced plasma control is urgent.}

journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
abstract = {A neural network, BES-ELMnet, predicting a quasi-periodic disruptive eruption of the plasma energy and particles known as edge localized mode (ELM) onset is developed with observed pedestal turbulence from the beam emission spectroscopy system in DIII-D. BES-ELMnet has convolutional and fully-connected layers, taking two-dimensional plasma fluctuations with a temporal window of size 128 µs and generating a scalar output which can be interpreted as a probability of the upcoming ELM onset. As approximately labeled inter-ELM broadband () fluctuations are given to the network, BES-ELMnet learns by itself ELM-related precursors arising before the onsets through supervised learning scheme. BES-ELMnet achieves the gradually increasing ELM onset probabilities between two consecutive ELMs during the inter-ELM phases and can forecast the first ELM onsets which occur after the high confinement mode transition. We further investigate the network generality in terms of the selected frequency band to ensure the use of BES-ELMnet for various operation regimes without changing the trained architecture. Therefore, our novel prediction method will enhance a proactive high confinement mode control of fusion-grade plasmas.}

abstract={Currently, our general approach to retrieving molecular structures from ultrafast gas-phase diffraction heavily relies on complex ab initio electronic or vibrational excited state simulations to make conclusive interpretations. Without such simulations, inverting this measurement for the structural probability distribution is typically intractable. This creates a so-called inverse problem. Here we address this inverse problem by developing a broadly applicable method that approximates the molecular frame structure ∣$\Psi$(R,{\thinspace}t)∣2 distribution independent of these complex simulations. We retrieve the vibronic ground state ∣$\Psi$(R)∣2 for both simulated stretched NO2 and measured N2O. From measured N2O, we observe 40 m{\AA} coordinate-space resolution from 3.75 {\AA}−1 reciprocal space range and poor signal-to-noise, a 50X improvement over traditional Fourier transform methods. In simulated NO2 diffraction experiments, typical to high signal-to-noise levels predict 100--1000X resolution improvements, down to 0.1 m{\AA}. By directly measuring the width of ∣$\Psi$(R)∣2, we open ultrafast gas-phase diffraction capabilities to measurements beyond current analysis approaches. This method has the potential to effectively turn gas-phase ultrafast diffraction into a discovery-oriented technique to probe systems that are prohibitively difficult to simulate.},

  abstract={With Moore's law coming to an end and the increasing computational complexity of deep neural network models, a noticeable gap is emerging between the limited computing power available at the edge and the potential of machine learning for instrumentation. Unlike classical deep neural networks, spiking neural networks utilize asynchronous computing and exhibit inherent low-power computing potential, making them ideal for processing large amounts of high-rate event-based data. To showcase this approach, we provide an initial proof of concept that focuses on the CookieBox - an angular streaking detector developed for LCLS-II placed upstream as an online beam diagnostic tool. We utilized a surrogate gradient learning approach to train a basic spiking neural network capable of characterizing individual X-ray pulse using the CookieBox data. The spiking neural network achieves an overall classification accuracy of 86 \%, which is comparable to the accuracy achieved by the most recent convolutional neural network performing the same task. We also addressed key elements to enable spiking neural networks capabilities in terms of power and latency requirements for edge machine learning in science experiments. The proposed approach demonstrates and validates that a simple spiking neural network can compete with sophisticated deep neural network and has significant implications for the field of edge machine learning for scientific data acquisition.},

  abstract={Over the past decade, a developments in radiation and photonic detectors has significantly improved their resolution, pixel density, sensitivity, and sampling rate. The increase in sampling rate corresponds to a considerable increase in generated data, the movement and storage of which requires a large number of storage units with very high bandwidth interconnects to the sensors themselves. The paradigm of edge computing, however, proposes to move the data processing closer to the source, the edge, rather than moving data to processing. Still, the computation resources are limited at the edge and it is necessary to use lean and robust algorithms. Machine learning (ML) is commonly used to identify patterns and relationships in minimally processed data. EdgeML is a combination of ML and edge computing that leverages a combination of benefits from ML algorithms and edge computing. In this paper, we demonstrate a high-speed and configurable ML model in a fully customizable EdgeML flow. Our demonstration focuses on an angular streaking detector developed for the LCLS-II project known as the CookieBox. The flow starts by emulating the CookieBox, digitizing the signals, and passing them to an optimized ML model on the FPGA. By using our ML implementation in this flow, we are able to achieve a 2.7 μs of inference latency. This flow can also be configured for other instrumentation applications that require low-latency solutions.},

abstract = {New, hard x-ray free electron lasers (FEL) produce intense femtosecond-to-attosecond pulses at angstrom wavelengths, giving access to the fundamental spatial and temporal scales of matter. These revolutionary light sources open the door to applying the suite of nonlinear, optical spectroscopy methods at hard x-ray photon energies. Nonlinear spectroscopy with hard x-rays can allow for measuring the coherence properties of short wavelength excitations with atomic specificity and for understanding how high energy excitations couple to other degrees of freedom in atomic, molecular or condensed-phase systems. As a step in this direction, here we present hard x-ray, optical four-wave mixing (4WM) measurements done at 9.8 keV at the split-and-delay line at the x-ray correlation spectroscopy (XCS) hutch of the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). In this work, we create an x-ray transient grating (TG) from a pair of crossing x-ray beams and diffract optical laser pulses at 400\&\#x2005;nm from the TG. The key technical advance here is being able to independently vary the delays of the x-ray pulses. Measurements were made in 3 different solid samples: bismuth germinate (BGO), zinc oxide (ZnO) and yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG). The resulting phase-matched, 4WM signal is measured in two different ways: by varying the x-ray, x-ray pulse delay which can reveal both material and light source coherence properties and also by varying the optical laser delay with respect to the x-ray TG to study how the x-ray excitation couples to the optical properties. Although no coherent 4WM signal was seen in these measurements, the absence of this signal gives important information on experimental requirements for detecting this in future work. Also, our laser-delay scans, although not a new measurement, were applied to different materials than in past work and reveal new examples x-ray induced lattice dynamics in solids. This work represents a key step towards extending nonlinear optics and time-resolved spectroscopy into the hard x-ray regime.},

abstract={X-ray free-electron laser sources enable time-resolved X-ray studies with unmatched temporal resolution. To fully exploit ultrashort X-ray pulses, timing tools are essential. However, new high repetition rate X-ray facilities present challenges for currently used timing tool schemes. Here we address this issue by demonstrating a sensitive timing tool scheme to enhance experimental time resolution in pump-probe experiments at very high pulse repetition rates. Our method employs a self-referenced detection scheme using a time-sheared chirped optical pulse traversing an X-ray stimulated diamond plate. By formulating an effective medium theory, we confirm subtle refractive index changes, induced by sub-milli-Joule intense X-ray pulses, that are measured in our experiment. The system utilizes a Common-Path-Interferometer to detect X-ray-induced phase shifts of the optical probe pulse transmitted through the diamond sample. Owing to the thermal stability of diamond, our approach is well-suited for MHz pulse repetition rates in superconducting linear accelerator-based free-electron lasers.},

ABSTRACT={Raw data generation for several existing and planned large physics experiments now exceeds TB/s rates, generating untenable data sets in very little time. Those data often demonstrate high dimensionality while containing limited information. Meanwhile, Machine Learning algorithms are now becoming an essential part of data processing and data analysis. Those algorithms can be used offline for post processing and post data analysis, or they can be used online for real time processing providing ultra low latency experiment monitoring. Both use cases would benefit from data throughput reduction while preserving relevant information: one by reducing the offline storage requirements by several orders of magnitude and the other by allowing ultra fast online inferencing with low complexity Machine Learning models. Moreover, reducing the data source throughput also reduces material cost, power and data management requirements. In this work we demonstrate optimized nonuniform scalar quantization for data source reduction. This data reduction allows lower dimensional representations while preserving the relevant information of the data, thus enabling high accuracy Tiny Machine Learning classifier models for online fast inferences. We demonstrate this approach with an initial proof of concept targeting the CookieBox, an array of electron spectrometers used for angular streaking, that was developed for LCLS-II as an online beam diagnostic tool. We used the Lloyd-Max algorithm with the CookieBox dataset to design an optimized nonuniform scalar quantizer. Optimized quantization lets us reduce input data volume by 69\% with no significant impact on inference accuracy. When we tolerate a 2\% loss on inference accuracy, we achieved 81\% of input data reduction. Finally, the change from a 7-bit to a 3-bit input data quantization reduces our neural network size by 38\%.}

For the Department of Energy’s major research facilities, this developing technology will enable a highly adaptive approach to experimental sciences. In this manuscript we present the per-epoch and end-to-end training times for an example of a streaming diagnostic that is planned for the upcoming high-repetition rate x-ray Free Electron Laser, the Linac Coherent Light Source-II. We explore the parameter space of batch size and data parallel training across multiple Graphics Processing Units and Reconfigurable Dataflow Units. We show the landscape of training times with a goal of full model retraining in under 15 min. Although a full from scratch retraining of a model may not be required in all cases, we nevertheless present an example of the application of emerging computational hardware for adapting machine learning models to changing environments in real-time, during streaming data acquisition, at the rates expected for the data fire hoses of accelerator-based user facilities.}

We do so in the context of a paradigmatic example of machine learning as applied in data acquisition at high data velocity scientific user facilities such as the Linac Coherent Light Source-II x-ray Free-Electron Laser. We discuss how a low-latency inference model operating at the data acquisition edge can capitalize on the naturally stochastic nature of such sources. We simulate the method of attosecond angular streaking to produce representative results whereby simulated input data reproduce high-resolution ground truth probability distributions. By minimizing the mean-squared error between the decoded output of the latent representation and the ground truth distributions, we ensure that the encoding layers and resulting latent representation maintains full fidelity for any downstream task, be it classification or regression. We present throughput results for data-parallel inference of various batch sizes, some with throughput exceeding 100 k images per second. We also show in situ training below 10 s per epoch for the full encoder–decoder model as would be relevant for streaming and adaptive real-time data production at our nation’s scientific light sources.}

abstract="The LCLS2 Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate x-ray pulses to beamline experiments at up to 1 Mhz. These experimentals will require new ultra-high rate (UHR) detectors that can operate at rates above 100 kHz and generate data throughputs upwards of 1 TB/s, a data velocity which requires prohibitively large investments in storage infrastructure. Machine Learning has demonstrated the potential to digest large datasets to extract relevant insights, however current implementations show latencies that are too high for real-time data reduction objectives. SLAC has endeavored on the creation of a software framework which translates MLs structures for deployment on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) deployed at the Edge of the data chain, close to the instrumentation. This framework leverages Xilinx's HLS framework presenting an API modeled after the open source Keras interface to the TensorFlow library. This SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL) framework is designed with a streaming data approach, optimizing the data flow between layers, while minimizing the buffer data buffering requirements. The goal is to ensure the highest possible framerate while keeping the maximum latency constrained to the needs of the experiment. Our framework is designed to ensure the RTL implementation of the network layers supporting full re-deployment of weights and biases without requiring re-synthesis after training. The ability to reduce the precision of the implemented networks through quantization is necessary to optimize the use of both DSP and memory resources in the FPGA. We currently have a preliminary version of the toolset and are experimenting with both general purpose example networks and networks being designed for specific LCLS2 experiments.",

This array also enables angle-resolved, high-resolution eToF spectroscopy to address a variety of scientific questions on ultrafast and nonlinear light{--}matter inter{\-}actions at FELs. The presented device is specifically designed for the time-resolved atomic, molecular and optical science endstation (TMO) at LCLSII. In its final version, the spectrometer comprises up to 20 eToF spectrometers aligned to collect electrons from the interaction point, which is defined by the intersection of the incoming FEL radiation and a gaseous target. The full composition involves 16 spectrometers forming a circular equiangular array in the plane normal to the X-ray propagation and four spectrometers at 54.7{$^\circ$} angle relative to the principle linear X-ray polarization axis with orientations in the forward and backward direction of the light propagation. The spectrometers are capable of independent and minimally chromatic electrostatic lensing and retardation, in order to enable simultaneous angle-resolved photo- and Auger{--}Meitner electron spectroscopy with high energy resolution. They are designed to ensure an energy resolution of 0.25eV across an energy window of up to 75eV, which can be individually centered via the adjustable retardation to cover the full range of electron kinetic energies relevant to soft X-ray methods, 0{--}2keV. The full spectrometer array will enable non-invasive and online spectral-polarimetry measurements, polarization-sensitive attoclock spectroscopy for characterizing the full time{--}energy structure of SASE or seeded LCLSII pulses, and support emerging trends in molecular-frame spectroscopy measurements.},

%abstract={In this work, we continue our study of a new method for the detection of ionizing radiation with the potential for a dramatic improvement in coincidence time resolution (CTR) for time-of-flight positron emission tomography (ToF-PET) using the modulation of a material's optical properties instead of the scintillation mechanism. Our previous work has shown that for non-scintillation materials such as bismuth silicon oxide (BSO) and cadmium telluride (CdTe), their refractive index can be modulated by annihilation photon interactions. The ultrafast nature of this process however remains unexplored. The ionizing radiation-induced charge carriers alter the local band structure in these materials, thus changing the complex refractive index. This mechanism is routinely used at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) facility of the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory to measure X-ray pulse arrival times with femtosecond scale resolution for photon energies between 0.5 -- 10 keV. The method described here follows that example by using a frequency chirped visible continuum pulse to provide a monotonic wavelength-to-time mapping by which one can measure the time-dependent refractive index modulation. In addition, we describe an interference-based measurement setup that allows for significantly improved sensitivity while preserving a timing precision of approximately 10 fs (σ) when measuring the arrival time of below 10 keV X-ray pulses with yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG) crystal. The method is presented in the context of ToF-PET application with further discussions on the potential CTR achievable if a similar detection concept is adopted for detecting 511 keV photons. Semi-empirical analysis indicates that the predicted CTR achievable is on the order of 1 ps (FWHM).}

%abstract={Short wavelength free-electron lasers (FELs), providing pulses of ultrahigh photon intensity, have revolutionized spectroscopy on ionic targets. Their exceptional photon flux enables multiple photon absorptions within a single femtosecond pulse, which in turn allows for deep insights into the photoionization process itself as well as into evolving ionic states of a target. Here we employ ultraintense pulses from the FEL FERMI to spectroscopically investigate the sequential emission of electrons from gaseous, atomic argon in the neutral as well as the ionic ground state. A pronounced forward-backward symmetry breaking of the angularly resolved emission patterns with respect to the light propagation direction is experimentally observed and theoretically explained for the region of the Cooper minimum, where the asymmetry of electron emission is strongly enhanced. These findings aim to originate a better understanding of the fundamentals of photon momentum transfer in ionic matter.},

%abstract = { The ability to produce ultrashort, high-brightness X-ray pulses is revolutionizing the field of ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy. Free-electron laser (FEL) facilities are driving this revolution, but unique aspects of the FEL process make the required characterization and use of the pulses challenging. In this paper, we describe a number of developments in the generation of ultrashort X-ray FEL pulses, and the concomitant progress in the experimental capabilities necessary for their characterization and use at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This includes the development of sub-femtosecond hard and soft X-ray pulses, along with ultrafast characterization techniques for these pulses. We also describe improved techniques for optical cross-correlation as needed to address the persistent challenge of external optical laser synchronization with these ultrashort X-ray pulses.

%	abstract = {The time–energy information of ultrashort X-ray free-electron laser pulses generated by the Linac Coherent Light Source is measured with attosecond resolution via angular streaking of neon 1s photoelectrons. The X-ray pulses promote electrons from the neon core level into an ionization continuum, where they are dressed with the electric field of a circularly polarized infrared laser. This induces characteristic modulations of the resulting photoelectron energy and angular distribution. From these modulations we recover the single-shot attosecond intensity structure and chirp of arbitrary X-ray pulses based on self-amplified spontaneous emission, which have eluded direct measurement so far. We characterize individual attosecond pulses, including their instantaneous frequency, and identify double pulses with well-defined delays and spectral properties, thus paving the way for X-ray pump/X-ray probe attosecond free-electron laser science.}

We show that this type of reconstruction algorithm is robust against counting noise and suitable for single-shot experiments.

ABSTRACT = {For the investigation of processes happening on the time scale of the motion of bound electrons, well-controlled X-ray pulses with durations in the few-femtosecond and even sub-femtosecond range are a necessary prerequisite. Novel free-electron lasers sources provide these ultrashort, high-brightness X-ray pulses, but their unique aspects open up concomitant challenges for their characterization on a suitable time scale. In this review paper we describe progress and results of recent work on ultrafast pulse characterization at soft and hard X-ray free-electron lasers. We report on different approaches to laser-assisted time-domain measurements, with specific focus on single-shot characterization of ultrashort X-ray pulses from self-amplified spontaneous emission-based and seeded free-electron lasers. The method relying on the sideband measurement of X-ray electron ionization in the presence of a dressing optical laser field is described first. When the X-ray pulse duration is shorter than half the oscillation period of the streaking field, few-femtosecond characterization becomes feasible via linear streaking spectroscopy. Finally, using terahertz fields alleviates the issue of arrival time jitter between streaking laser and X-ray pulse, but compromises the achievable temporal resolution. Possible solutions to these remaining challenges for single-shot, full time–energy characterization of X-ray free-electron laser pulses are proposed in the outlook at the end of the review.},

%abstract = {X-ray free-electron lasers are unique sources of high-brightness coherent radiation. However, existing devices supply only linearly polarized light, precluding studies of chiral dynamics. A device called the Delta undulator has been installed at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) to provide tunable polarization. With a reverse tapered planar undulator line to pre-microbunch the beam and the novel technique of beam diverting, hundreds of microjoules of circularly polarized X-ray pulses are produced at 500–1,200 eV. These X-ray pulses are tens of femtoseconds long, have a degree of circular polarization of 0.98–0.04+0.02 at 707 eV and may be scanned in energy. We also present a new two-colour X-ray pump–X-ray probe operating mode for the LCLS. Energy differences of ΔE/E = 2.4\% are supported, and the second pulse can be adjusted to any elliptical polarization. In this mode, the pointing, timing, intensity and wavelength of the two pulses can be modified.}

AB  - The X-ray free-electron laser has opened a new era for photon science, improving the X-ray brightness by ten orders of magnitude over previously available sources. Similar to an optical laser, the spectral and temporal structure of the radiation pulses can be tailored to the specific needs of many experiments by accurately manipulating the lasing medium, that is, the electron beam. Here we report the generation of mJ-level two-colour hard X-ray pulses of few femtoseconds duration with an XFEL driven by twin electron bunches at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This performance represents an improvement of over an order of magnitude in peak power over state-of-the-art two-colour XFELs. The unprecedented intensity and temporal coherence of this new two-colour X-ray free-electron laser enable an entirely new set of scientific applications, ranging from X-ray pump/X-ray probe experiments to the imaging of complex biological samples with multiple wavelength anomalous dispersion.

%abstract={Here we present the first angle-resolved, non-resonant (normal) Auger spectra for impulsively aligned nitrogen molecules. We have measured the angular pattern of Auger electron emission following K -shell photoionization by 1.1 keV photons from the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS). Using strong-field-induced molecular alignment to make molecular frame measurements is equally effective for both repulsive and quasi-bound final states. The capability to resolve Auger emission angular distributions in the molecular frame of reference provides a new tool for spectral assignments in congested Auger electron spectra that takes advantage of the symmetries of the final diction states. Based on our experimental results and theoretical predictions, we propose the assignment of the spectral features in the Auger electron spectrum.}

%abstract={Two-color, single-shot time-of-flight electron spectroscopy of atomic neon was employed at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) to measure laser-assisted Auger decay in the x-ray regime. This x-ray-optical cross-correlation technique provides a straightforward, non-invasive and on-line means of determining the duration of femtosecond (>40 fs) x-ray pulses. In combination with a theoretical model of the process based on the soft-photon approximation, we were able to obtain the LCLS pulse duration and to extract a mean value of the temporal jitter between the optical pulses from a synchronized Ti-sapphire laser and x-ray pulses from the LCLS. We find that the experimentally determined values are systematically smaller than the length of the electron bunches. Nominal electron pulse durations of 175 and 75 fs, as provided by the LCLS control system, yield x-ray pulse shapes of 120±20 fs full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and an upper limit of 40±20 fs FWHM, respectively. Simulations of the free-electron laser agree well with the experimental results.}

The LCLS is a true x-ray laser, approximately one billion times brighter than any previous laboratory source of x-ray radiation. Here we review some of the first atomic, molecular, and optical experiments that probe the fundamental interactions of such uniquely bright and short x-ray pulses with atoms and molecules, summarize some of the theory leading up to these experiments and conclude with some ideas on future avenues of investigation.}

%abstract = {We present a new technique for measuring the relative delay between a soft x-ray FEL pulse and an optical laser that indicates a sub 25 fs RMS measurement error. An ultra-short x-ray pulse photo-ionizes a semiconductor (Si3N4) membrane and changes the optical transmission. An optical continuum pulse with a temporally chirped bandwidth spanning 630 nm -- 710 nm interacts with the membrane such that the timing of the x-ray pulse can be determined from the onset of the spectral modulation of the transmitted optical pulse. This experiment demonstrates a nearly in situ single-shot measurement of the x-ray pulse arrival time relative to the ultra-short optical pulse.}

It produces coherent soft and hard X-rays with peak brightness nearly ten orders of magnitude beyond conventional synchrotron sources and a range of pulse durations from 500 to <10 fs (10−15 s). With these beam characteristics this light source is capable of imaging the structure and dynamics of matter at atomic size and timescales. The facility is now operating at X-ray wavelengths from 22 to 1.2 {\AA} and is presently delivering this high-brilliance beam to a growing array of scientific researchers. We describe the operation and performance of this new `fourth-generation light source'.},

Our measured alignment shows an improvement over previous one-pulse or two-pulse experimental alignment results and approaches the theoretical maximum value. We employ eight equally spaced ultrafast laser pulses with a separation that takes advantage of the periodic revivals for the ensemble of quantum rotors. Each successive pulse increases the transient alignment [<$\cos^2 \theta$>(t)] and also moves the rotational population away from thermal equilibrium. These measurements are combined with simulations to determine the value of <$\cos^2 \theta$>, the J-state distributions, and the functional dependencies of the alignment features.}"

%abstract = "{Using pump-probe spectroscopy with ultrashort laser pulses, we see an enhancement of the charge-asymmetric dissociation (CAD) channel, $I_2^{2+}\rightarrow I^{2+) + I$, over a narrow range of internuclear separation, in addition to the previously studied enhanced ionization of this species. 
%The enhancement of the CAD channel appears to come from excitation of the symmetric ground state dissociation channel $(I^+ + I^+)$ for two reasons: there is a depletion in the symmetric channel at approximately the same pump-probe delay as the asymmetric enhancement, and the symmetric channel decreases while the asymmetric channel increases as a function of probe intensity at a fixed delay.
%In addition, we find that the kinetic energies of the of the extra I2+ + I ions decrease for increasing delay.
%A more complete understanding of these observations depends strongly on the little known potential energy curves of the various charge states of $I_2$. Thus, we use model potential curves to explain the delay dependence of the kinetic energy release. The excitation appears to be produced by a resonant 3-photon transition within I$_2^{2+}$ rather than by ionization of I$_2^+$.}"
