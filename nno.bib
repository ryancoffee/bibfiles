Phys. 103, 5931–5938 (1995)], we reinvestigated the overtone spectrum of nitrous oxide (14N216O) using intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy, observing seven new bands in the spectral range 10 650–12 200 cm−1 and improving the signal-to-noise ratio in two others previously reported using Fourier transform spectroscopy. The earlier \{FT\} line positions, in the range 6500–11 000 cm−1, have been calibrated using the 3–0 vibration–rotation line wavenumbers in 12C16O as references. A previously unreported hot band is spotted on the \{FT\} spectrum, at 7229 cm−1. Vibration–rotation parameters are provided for all newly analyzed bands and significantly improved for most previously reported \{FT\} bands by accounting for more lines in the fitting procedure than earlier. All bands are vibrationally assigned in agreement with theoretical predictions. A table listing all levels above 6500 cm−1 reported in the literature is provided. "

abstract = "Theoretical values of vibrational frequencies and rotational constants for all the isotopomers of nitrous oxide are reported. The calculations are carried out variationally using an empirical Morse-cosine potential energy surface previously determined for N2O, and a set of optimal internal vibrational coordinates. The spectroscopic constants obtained are compared to those extracted from spectroscopic measurements for the 14N216O, 14N15N16O, 15N14N16O, 15N216O, 14N217O, and 14N218O isotopomers. The agreement between calculated and observed values for these isotopomers is shown to be excellent, especially for the rotational constants. As a result, an unidentified band recently recorded is properly assigned. The spectroscopic constants computed for the rest of the isotopomers, for which observed information is much scarcer, have therefore a predictive character. The vibrational zero point energies for all the \{N2O\} isotopomers are also given. "

abstract = { The vibrational spectrum of N2O as given by an effective spectroscopic Hamiltonian based on the existence of a superpolyad number is analyzed and assigned in terms of classical motions. The effective Hamiltonian includes a large number of resonances of which only one is dominant for low and intermediate superpolyad numbers. In this energy range, the corresponding classical system is quasi-integrable and can be described in terms of a system with only one nontrivial degree of freedom. This integrable system can be analyzed by considering the so-called “quantizing trajectories” on a “polyad sphere”. This method is no longer applicable when the superpolyad number is further increased and classical chaos comes into play. We then turn to a powerful universal method based on the graphical representation of semiclassical wave functions on a naturally appearing toroidal configuration space. These wave functions are obtained using the already known transformation matrix used in fitting the effective Hamiltonian. Experience with the interpretation of the resulting figures allows one to draw conclusions on the classical internal motions and therefore on the assignment of the quantum states without any further calculation. As such, the method is of particular interest to nontheorists and to nonspecialists in the fields of nonlinear dynamics and quantum calculation. For higher superpolyad numbers, the chaos remains mainly concentrated about the direct neighborhood of a separatrix of the former integrable system so that a great part of the vibrational spectrum can still be assigned in terms of the EBK quantum numbers of quantized tori. }

abstract = "The line positions and strengths of \{N2O\} were measured from absorption spectra obtained at high spectral resolution (0.011 cm−1) in the region between 3515 and 7800 cm−1. Measurements include line frequencies and strengths of several \{N2O\} isotopes, a few of which are reported for the first time, to my knowledge. Also in this category are two π-π bands, six Δ-Δ bands, and five Σ-Σ bands of 14N216O. Measurements also include eight 14N216O bands of which several transitions of each band were perturbed due to resonance interactions with transitions of a perturbing band. For most cases, the positions and strengths of the strongest interacting transitions of the perturbing bands were measured. "

	abstract = "The experimental technique which consists of exciting a mixture of \{N2O\} and \{N2\} by radio frequency is very efficient for populating very high vibrational levels. Twelve emission spectra of mixtures of \{N2O\} and \{N2\} were recorded with a Fourier transform spectrometer at resolutions of 0.006, 0.004, and 0.003 cm−1 in the 4.5-μm region. Among the already known transitions, 10 new vibrational transitions which occur between highly excited levels have been observed. In particular, we have detected the very weak transitions 0005→0004 .and 0404→0403, which involve the interacting levels 0005 and 0404. The wavenumbers are reported as well as the derived spectroscopic parameters, which allow one to reproduce the experimental wavenumbers within experimental accuracy (&lt;4×10−4 cm−1). The results are in good agreement with the new predictions of \{N2O\} line positions which have been made using a model calculation based upon the effective hamiltonian approach. "
