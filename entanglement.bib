abstract = {We use a genetic algorithm (GA) as a design aid for determining the optimal provisioning of entangled photon spectrum in flex-grid quantum networks with arbitrary numbers of channels and users. After introducing a general model for entanglement distribution based on frequency-polarization hyperentangled biphotons, we derive upper bounds on fidelity and entangled bit rate for networks comprising one-to-one user connections. Simple conditions based on user detector quality and link efficiencies are found that determine whether entanglement is possible. We successfully apply a GA to find optimal resource allocations in four different representative network scenarios and validate features of our model experimentally in a quantum local area network in deployed fiber. Our results show promise for the rapid design of large-scale entanglement distribution networks.},
