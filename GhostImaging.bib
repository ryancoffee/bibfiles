abstract = {Scatter-plate microscopy (SPM) is a lensless imaging technique for high-resolution imaging through scattering media. So far, the method was demonstrated for spatially incoherent illumination and static scattering media. In this publication, we demonstrate that these restrictions are not necessary. We realized imaging with spatially coherent and spatially incoherent illumination. We further demonstrate that SPM is still a valid imaging method for scatter-plates, which change their scattering behaviour (i.e. the phase-shift) at each position on the plate continuously but independently from other positions. Especially we realized imaging through rotating ground glass diffusers.},

abstract = {Ghost-imaging experiments correlate the outputs from two photodetectors: a               high-spatial-resolution (scanning pinhole or CCD array) detector that measures a               field that has not interacted with the object to be imaged, and a bucket               (single-pixel) detector that collects a field that has interacted with the object. We               give a comprehensive review of ghost imaging---within a unified Gaussian-state               framework---presenting detailed analyses of its resolution, field of view,               image contrast, and signal-to-noise ratio behavior. We consider three classes of               illumination: thermal-state (classical), biphoton-state (quantum), and               classical-state phase-sensitive light. The first two have been employed in a variety               of ghost-imaging demonstrations. The third is the classical Gaussian state that               produces ghost images that most closely mimic those obtained from biphoton               illumination. The insights we develop lead naturally to a new, single-beam approach               to ghost imaging, called computational ghost imaging, in which only the bucket               detector is required. We provide quantitative results while simultaneously               emphasizing the underlying physics of ghost imaging. The key to developing the latter               understanding lies in the coherence behavior of a pair of Gaussian-state light beams               with either phase-insensitive or phase-sensitive cross correlation.},

abstract = {Ghost imaging, Fourier transform spectroscopy, and the newly developed Hadamard transform crystallography are all examples of multiplexing measurement strategies. Multiplexed experiments are performed by measuring multiple points in space, time, or energy simultaneously. This contrasts to the usual method of systematically scanning single points. How do multiplexed measurements work and when they are advantageous? Here we address these questions with a focus on applications involving x-rays or electrons. We present a quantitative framework for analyzing the expected error and radiation dose of different measurement scheme that enables comparison. We conclude that in very specific situations, multiplexing can offer improvements in resolution and signal-to-noise. If the signal has a sparse representation, these advantages become more general and dramatic, and further less radiation can be used to complete a measurement.}
