In all cases{,} the observed populations of vibrationally excited NO are near those expected for complete thermalization with the surface{,} despite the fact that the scattering occurs through a direct {"}single bounce{"} mechanism of sub-ps duration. We present a state-to-state kinetic model{,} which accurately describes the case of near complete thermalization (a regime we call the strong coupling case) and use this model to extract state-to-state rate constants. This analysis unambiguously shows that direct vibrational overtone excitation dominates the production of [small nu] = 2 and that{,} within the context of our model{,} the intrinsic strength of the overtone transition is of the same order as the single quantum transition{,} suggesting a possible way to circumvent optical selection rules in vibrational pumping of molecules. This result also suggests that previous measurements of vibrational relaxation of highly vibrationally excited NO exhibiting highly efficient multi-quantum jumps ([capital Delta][small nu] [similar] -8) are mechanistically similar to vibrational excitation of NO([small nu] = 0)."

abstract  ="Clean hydrogen production is highly desirable for future energy needs{,} making the understanding of molecular-level phenomena underlying photocatalytic hydrogen production both fundamentally and practically important. Water splitting on pure TiO2 is inefficient{,} however{,} adding sacrificial methanol could significantly enhance the photocatalyzed H2 production. Therefore{,} understanding the photochemistry of methanol on TiO2 at the molecular level could provide important insights to its photocatalytic activity. Here{,} we report the first clear evidence of photocatalyzed splitting of methanol on TiO2 derived from time-dependent two-photon photoemission (TD-2PPE) results in combination with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). STM tip induced molecular manipulation before and after UV light irradiation clearly reveals photocatalytic bond cleavage{,} which occurs only at Ti4+ surface sites. TD-2PPE reveals that the kinetics of methanol photodissociation is clearly not of single exponential{,} an important characteristic of this intrinsically heterogeneous photoreaction."
}
A combined experimental and theoretical study has been carried out on the methanol/TiO2(110) system. A photoinduced excited resonance state on the CH3OH/TiO2(110) surface has been observed using time-dependent two-photon photoemission method. High resolution STM experiments performed in this work show that methanol adsorbed on the Ti4+ sites can be dissociated by UV light illumination with wavelength < 400 nm. In the dissociation of methanol, its hydroxyl hydrogen was transferred to the neighboring BBO site. This suggests that the excited electronic resonance observed is likely due to the dissociated methanol on TiO2 surface. DFT calculations found a new excited surface resonance state due to the dissociated methanol on TiO2. Time-dependent 2PPE measurements show that the rising kinetics of the excited resonance is clearly of heterogeneous nature.
The results obtained in this work have significant implications for photocatalysis on TiO2. Our results unambiguously show that the O–H bond in methanol is photochemically active on TiO2. This is undoubtedly an important aspect of the explanation of why hydrogen production is more efficient for methanol–water mixtures. Our results furthermore show that the Ti4+ out-of-plane puckering is an essential element of bond dissociation on this surface, suggesting that Ti4+ is the key catalytic site for photoinduced chemistry on TiO2.
