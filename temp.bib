  abstract={We report the first measurement of the kinetic energy release distributions of multiply charged oxygen ions produced in collisions of O 2 molecules with 5.9 MeV/amu Xe 18+ and Xe 43+ ions. The slow O q + ions generated in the collision are detected in coincidence by a time- and position sensitive multi- particle detector. An analysis of correlated momenta of molecular fragments provides the kinetic energy release distribution for various reaction pairs O 2 â†’ O q 1 +O q 2+ with a total charge up to q = q 1 + q 2 = 11. The position of the maximum and the width of the distributions are well described by the recently suggested Average Bunch Statistical (ABS) model.}
