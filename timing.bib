%abstract = {
%The development of Free Electron Lasers has opened the possibility to investigate ultrafast processes using femtosecond hard x-ray pulses. In optical/x-ray light pump/probe experiments, however, the time resolution is mainly limited by the ability to synchronize both light sources over a long distance (100 fs FWHM) rather than their pulse length (10 fs FWHM). We have implemented a spectrally encoding x-ray to optical laser timing diagnostic into the XPP beamline at LCLS with a timing uncertainty down to 10 fs. An x-ray induced change of refractive index in a solid target is temporally probed for single pulses by a chirped white light pulse [4]. By resorting single shot data to the timestamps obtained by the diagnostics, the temporal data quality can be improved to basically pulse length limited time resolution. By interchangable targets and adjustable x-ray and laser foci, the method was successfully applied for very different x-ray parameters. These are different photon energies in the range of 6-20 keV, which at LCLS also includes application of 3rd Harmonic radiation, pulse energy, and bandwidth, when using a Si(111) monochromator.

abstract = {The recent development of x-ray free electron lasers providing coherent, femtosecond-long pulses of high brilliance and variable energy opens new areas of scientific research in a variety of disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and biology. Pump-probe experimental techniques which observe the temporal evolution of systems after optical or x-ray pulse excitation are one of the main experimental schemes currently in use for ultrafast studies. The key challenge in these experiments is to reliably achieve temporal and spatial overlap of the x-ray and optical pulses. Here we present measurements of the x-ray pulse induced transient change of optical reflectivity from a variety of materials covering the soft x-ray photon energy range from 500eV to 2000eV and outline the use of this technique to establish and characterize temporal synchronization of the optical-laser and FEL x-ray pulses.},
