    abstract = "{The study aimed to investigate the underlying physics limiting the temperature stability and performance of non-surface passivated Al0.34Ga0.66N/GaN Hall effect sensors, including contacts, under atmospheric conditions. The results obtained from analyzing the microstructural evolution in the Al0.34Ga0.66N/GaN Hall sensor heterostructure were found to correlate with the electrical performance of the Hall effect sensor. High-resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies revealed the signature of surface oxidation in the GaN cap layer, as well as a slight out-diffusion of “Al” from the AlGaN barrier layer. To prevent the formation of a bumpy surface morphology at the Ohmic contact, we investigated the impact of “Pt” top Ohmic contacts. The application of a top “Pt” contact stack resulted in a smooth Ohmic contact surface and provided evidence that the bumpy surface morphology in Au-based Ohmic contacts is due to the formation of an Al-Au viscous alloy during rapid thermal annealing. In the early stages of thermal aging, the small drop in contact resistivity stabilized with subsequent thermal aging past the initial 550 h at 200 °C. The outcome is that the Al0.34Ga0.66N/GaN Hall effect sensors, even without surface passivation, exhibited a stable response to applied magnetic fields with no sign of significant degradation after 2800 h of thermal aging at 200 °C under atmospheric conditions. This observed stability in the Hall sensor without surface passivation can be attributed to a self-imposed surface oxidation of the cap layer during the early stages of aging, which serves as a protective layer for the device during subsequent extended periods of thermal aging at 200 °C.}",

The GaN transistor in this work was subjected to prolonged exposure (11 days) in a simulated Venus environment (460 °C, 94 bar, complete chemical environment including CO2/N2/SO2). The mechanisms affecting the transistor performance and structural integrity in harsh environment were analyzed using a variety of experimental, simulation, and modeling techniques, including in situ electrical measurement (e.g., burn-in) and advanced microscopy (e.g., structural deformation). Through transistor, Transmission Line Method (TLM), and Hall-effect measurements vs temperature, it is revealed that the mobility decrease is the primary cause of reduction of on-state performance of this GaN transistor at high temperature. Material analysis of the device under test (DUT) confirmed the absence of foreign elements from the Venus atmosphere. No inter-diffusion of the elements (including the gate metal) was observed. The insights of this work are broadly applicable to the future design, fabrication, and deployment of robust III-N devices for harsh environment operation.}",

The devices were irradiated with 200 keV protons to a fluence of 1016 cm−2. Examination of the x-ray diffraction (XRD) rocking curves indicates a preferred (100) orientation prior to irradiation, with decrease in crystal quality afterward. Additionally, peak shifts in XRD and Raman spectra of the control sample relative to well-known theoretical positions are indicative of tensile strain in the as-deposited ZnO films. Shifts toward theoretical unstrained positions are observed in the irradiated films, which indicates partial relaxation. Raman spectra also indicate increase in oxygen vacancies (VO) and zinc interstitial defects (Zni) compared to the control sample. Additionally, transient photocurrent measurements performed on each sample at different temperatures showed up to 2× increase in photocurrent decay time constants for irradiated samples vs the control. This persistent photoconductive behavior is linked to the activation of electron and hole traps near the surface, and to the desorption and reabsorption of O2 molecules on the ZnO surface under the influence of UV light. Using an Arrhenius model, trap activation energies were extracted and, by comparing with known energies from the literature, the dominant defects contributing to persistent photoconductivity for each irradiation condition were identified. The persistence of differences in photocurrent transients between different samples months after irradiation indicates that the defects introduced by the suppression of thermally activated dynamic annealing processes have a long-term deleterious effect on device performance.}",

    abstract = "{We investigated the thermal stability and performance of AlGaN/AlN/GaN Hall-effect sensors under industry-relevant atmospheric conditions. The thermal stability and performance of Hall sensors are evaluated by monitoring Hall sensitivity, two-dimensional electron gas density, and Ohmic contact resistance during aging at 200 °C for up to 2800 h under atmospheric conditions. This was accomplished by characterizing AlGaN/AlN/GaN micro-Hall sensors, with and without contacts, and before and after being placed under different thermal aging times. Observed electrical performance was correlated with the micro-structural evolution of AlGaN/AlN/GaN Hall sensor heterostructures. Results indicate that the AlGaN/AlN/GaN Hall sensor provides stable performance for as long as 2800 h aging at 200 °C without any significant degradation of (i) Hall sensitivity, (ii) two-dimensional electron gas, and (iii) Ohmic contacts. However, there was a small change in sheet density and mobility, which is due to a decrease in polarization, resulting from local inhomogeneous strain relief at the barrier layer. During the early stage of thermal aging, a decrease in contact resistance was also observed and attributed to (i) out-diffusion of “Ga” at the vicinity of the contact interface, and (ii) a reduction in oxygen concentration and formation of Al–Ti intermediate alloy at the GaN/Ti interface, resulting in a reduced barrier and enhanced electron transport at the contacts. However, despite these small changes, results indicate that the AlGaN/AlN/GaN Hall sensor provides stable performance for as long as 2800 h thermal aging at 200 °C.}",

Both devices showed decreasing voltage-scaled magnetic sensitivity at high temperatures, declining from 53 mV/V/T to 8.3 mV/V/T for the InAlN/GaN sample and from 89 mV/V/T to 8.5 mV/V/T for the AlGaN/GaN sample, corresponding to the decreasing electron mobility due to scattering effects at elevated temperatures. Alternatively, current-scaled sensitivities remained stable over the temperature range, only varying by 13.1\% from the mean of 26.3 V/A/T and 10.5\% from the mean of 60.2 V/A/T for the InAlN/GaN and AlGaN/GaN samples, respectively. This is due to the minimal temperature dependence of the electron sheet density on the 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Both devices showed consistency in their voltage- and current-scaled sensitivity over multiple temperature cycles as well as nearly full recovery when returned to room temperature after thermal cycling. Additionally, an AlGaN/GaN sample held at 576 °C for 12 h also showed nearly full recovery at room temperature, further suggesting that GaN-based Hall-effect sensors are a good candidate for use in high temperature applications. }",

Three distinct regions in the reverse bias regime of operation and their corresponding dominant current transport mechanisms are identified. A trap-assisted tunneling mechanism is observed at low reverse bias, and trap energy levels are between 1.12 and 1.99 eV. At medium reverse bias, Poole–Frenkel emission is decomposed into low-field, mid-field, and high-field regions and the related trap activation energies vary from 0.38 to 2.04 eV. At high reverse bias, the Fowler–Nordheim model is applied and the effective barrier height to tunneling is 0.78 eV. The model of the reverse leakage current constructed using the parameters associated with these transport mechanisms closely aligns with the experimental data and supports the advancement of high-temperature electronics based on IrOx -gated InAlN/GaN heterostructure technology.}",

Individual pixels in the test structures of the fabricated devices were instrumented to characterize their charge transfer capability and to study their operation in low readout noise conditions. We were able to operate the pixel in single carrier counting mode with deep sub-electron noise to measure charge packets collected by the photodiode when exposed to low illumination levels.

Connecting a bulk material’s microscopic defects to its macroscopic properties is an age-old problem in materials science. Long-range interactions between dislocations (line defects) are known to play a key role in how materials deform or melt, but we lack the tools to connect these dynamics to the macroscopic properties. We introduce time-resolved dark-field x-ray microscopy to directly visualize how dislocations move and interact over hundreds of micrometers deep inside bulk aluminum. With real-time movies, we reveal the thermally activated motion and interactions of dislocations that comprise a boundary and show how weakened binding forces destabilize the structure at 99\% of the melting temperature. Connecting dynamics of the microstructure to its stability, we provide important opportunities to guide and validate multiscale models that are yet untested.}}

Recently, Dark field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) has emerged as a new tool to image and interpret dislocations within crystals using multidimensional scans. However, the methods required to reconstruct meaningful dislocation information from high-dimensional DFXM scans are still nascent and require significant manual oversight (i.e., supervision). In this work, we present a new relatively unsupervised method that extracts dislocation-specific information (features) from a 3D dataset (x, y, {\$}{\$}{\backslash}phi {\$}{\$}) using Gram--Schmidt orthogonalization to represent the large dataset as an array of 3-component feature vectors for each position, corresponding to the weak-beam conditions and the strong-beam condition. This method offers key opportunities to significantly reduce dataset size while preserving only the crystallographic information that is important for data reconstruction.},
