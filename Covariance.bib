ABSTRACT = {Dedicated simulations show that the application of time-domain ptychography to angular photo-electron streaking data allows shot-to-shot reconstruction of individual X-ray free electron laser pulses. Specifically, in this study, we use an extended ptychographic iterative engine to retrieve both the unknown X-ray pulse and the unknown streak field. We evaluate the quality of reconstruction versus spectral resolution, signal-to-noise and sampling size of the spectrogram.},

	abstract = {Recent technological advances in the generation of intense femtosecond pulses have made covariance mapping an attractive analytical technique. The laser pulses available are so intense that often thousands of ionisation and Coulomb explosion events will occur within each pulse. To understand the physics of these processes the photoelectrons and photoions need to be correlated, and covariance mapping is well suited for operating at the high counting rates of these laser sources. Partial covariance is particularly useful in experiments with x-ray free electron lasers, because it is capable of suppressing pulse fluctuation effects. A variety of covariance mapping methods is described: simple, partial (single- and multi-parameter), sliced, contingent and multi-dimensional. The relationship to coincidence techniques is discussed. Covariance mapping has been used in many areas of science and technology: inner-shell excitation and Auger decay, multiphoton and multielectron ionisation, time-of-flight and angle-resolved spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging, stimulated Raman scattering, directional gamma ray sensing, welding diagnostics and brain connectivity studies (connectomics). This review gives practical advice for implementing the technique and interpreting the results, including its limitations and instrumental constraints. It also summarises recent theoretical studies, highlights unsolved problems and outlines a personal view on the most promising research directions.}

	abstract = {In some cases there are hidden correlations in a highly fluctuating signal, but these are lost in a conventional averaging procedure. Covariance mapping allows these correlations to be revealed unambiguously. As an example of the applicability of this technique, the dynamics of fragmentation of molecules ionized by an intense picosecond laser are analyzed.},
