	abstract={Ultrashort terahertz pulses derived from femtosecond table-top sources have become a valuable tool for time-resolved spectroscopy during the last two decades. Until recently, the pulse energies and field strengths of these pulses have been generally too low to allow for the use as pump pulses or the study of nonlinear effects in the terahertz range. In this review article we will describe methods of generation of intense single cycle terahertz pulses with emphasis on optical rectification using the tilted-pulse-front pumping technique. We will also discuss some applications of these intense pulses in the emerging field of nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy.}

abstract = {The principles and most-recent results of high-power THz generation through optical rectification using a tilted optical pulse front are described. Single-cycle THz pulses of multimicrojoule energies are generated at kHz repetition rates, and average THz power levels exceeding 1 mW can be generated at kHz-MHz repetition rates. Applications in nonlinear THz spectroscopy and THz coherent control are discussed.},
