	abstract = {We analyze femtosecond supercontinuum generation in a distribution of thin solid plates to show that the distributed scheme inhibits processes leading to pulse breakup while allowing spectral expansion to proceed as desired. We introduce basic criteria for setting the plate thickness or initial laser intensity and the location of each plate in the laser beam path and confirm that under these conditions a fully-coherent and intense supercontinuum can be generated for input peak power of as much as two thousand times the critical power for self-focusing of the solid medium.},
