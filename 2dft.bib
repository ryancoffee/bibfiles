%abstract = {We demonstrate two-dimensional ultrafast fourier transform spectroscopy in the deep ultraviolet (~ 260 nm) using an acousto-optic modulator based pulse shaper. The use of a pulse shaper in the ultraviolet allows for rapid scanning, high phase (time) stability (~ 0.017 rad) and phase cycling. We present measurements on the DNA nucleobase Adenine.}

%In conclusion, we have demonstrated 2D Fourier transform spectroscopy in the deep ultraviolet
using an AOM based ultrafast laser pulse shaper. The technique is ideally suited for study-
ing the excited state dynamics of the many molecules whose S0-S1 transition lies in the deep
ultraviolet. By using a UV pulse shaper to perform the measurements, we naturally have ex-
cellent phase (time) stability and can perform rapid phase cycling, enhancing the data quality
and isolating desired nonlinear polarizations in the 2D spectrum.
