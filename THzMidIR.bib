abstract = {We introduce a scheme for single-shot detection and correction of the carrier-envelope phase (CEP) drift of femtosecond pulses at mid-IR wavelengths. Difference frequency mixing between the mid-IR field and a near-IR gate pulse generates a near-IR frequency-shifted pulse, which is then spectrally interfered with a replica of the gate pulse. The spectral interference pattern contains shot-to-shot information of the CEP of the mid-IR field, and it can be used for simultaneous correction of its slow drifts. We apply this technique to detect and compensate long-term phase drifts at 17 $\mu$m wavelength, reducing fluctuations to only 110 mrad over hours of operation.},

abstract = {Phase-locked terahertz transients with peak electric fields of 108 MV/cm and center frequencies continuously tunable from 10 to 72 THz are generated via difference-frequency mixing of two parametrically amplified pulse trains from a single white-light seed. Free space electro-optic sampling with 8 fs gating pulses from a two-branch Er:fiber laser allows us to monitor all transients directly in the time domain. We identify extreme terahertz nonlinearities in the detector crystal with subcycle resolution.},
