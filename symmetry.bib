abstract = "Abstract The vibronic coupling Hamiltonian is a standard model used to describe the potential energy surfaces of systems in which non-adiabatic coupling is a key feature. This includes Jahn–Teller and Renner–Teller systems. The model approximates diabatic potential energy functions as polynomials expanded about a point of high symmetry. One must ensure the model Hamiltonian belongs to the totally symmetric irreducible representation of this point group. Here, a simple approach is presented to generate functions that form a basis for totally symmetric irreducible representations of non-Abelian groups and apply it to D∞h (2D) and O (3D). For the O group, the use of a well known basis-generating operator is also required. The functions generated for D∞h are then used to construct a ten state, four coordinate model of acetylene. The calculated absorption spectrum is compared to the experimental spectrum to serve as a validation of the approach. "

    abstract = { Vibronic coupling theory shows that the cause for spontaneous instability in systems presenting a nondegenerate ground state is the so-called pseudo-Jahn–Teller effect, and thus its study can be extremely helpful to understand the structure of many molecules. While this theory, based on the mixing of the ground and excited states with a distortion, has been long studied, there are two obscure points that we try to clarify in the present work. First, the operators involved in both the vibronic and nonvibronic parts of the force constant take only into account electron–nuclear and nuclear–nuclear interactions, apparently leaving electron–electron repulsions and the electron’s kinetic energy out of the chemical picture. Second, a fully quantitative computational appraisal of this effect has been up to now problematic. Here, we present a reformulation of the pseudo-Jahn–Teller theory that explicitly shows the contributions of all operators in the molecular Hamiltonian and allows connecting the results obtained with this model to other chemical theories relating electron distribution and geometry. Moreover, we develop a practical approach based on Hartree–Fock and density functional theory that allows quantification of the pseudo-Jahn–Teller effect. We demonstrate the usefulness of our method studying the pyramidal distortion in ammonia and its absence in borane, revealing the strong importance of the kinetic energy of the electrons in the lowest a2″ orbital to trigger this instability. The present tool opens a window for exploring in detail the actual microscopic origin of structural instabilities in molecules and solids. }

    abstract = { It is shown that in linear molecules the pseudo-Jahn–Teller (PJT) interaction of a Σ or Π term with a Δ term induces a bending instability that is angular dependent, reducing the symmetry of the adiabatic potential energy surface from expected D∞h to D4h and C∞v to C2v or C4v. This spontaneously broken cylindrical symmetry (BCS) emerges from the solution of the vibronic coupling equations of the PJT effect (PJTE) problems (Σ+Δ)⊗w, (Π+Δ)⊗w, (Π+Σ+Δ)⊗w, and (Δ+Δ)⊗w, where w includes linear, quadratic, and fourth order vibronic coupling terms, and it is confirmed by ab initio calculations for a series of triatomic molecules with ground or excited Δ terms. The BCS is due to the angular symmetry of the electronic wave functions of the Δ term, ∼cos 2φ, and ∼sin 2φ, split by the fourth order vibronic coupling, which in overlap with the other symmetry wave functions of the Σ or Π term provides for the periodical symmetry of the added covalency that facilitates the bending. The mechanism of this PJT-induced BCS effect is discussed in detail; the numerical values of the vibronic coupling parameters for the molecules under consideration were estimated by means of combining separate ab initio calculations of some of them with a procedure fitting the analytical expressions to ab initio calculated energy profiles. It is also shown that the bending of linear molecules in Δ states, similar to Π states, is exclusively a PJT (not Renner–Teller) effect. The BCS revealed in this paper illustrates again the predicting power of the PJTE. }

abstract = { The Jahn-Teller effect in aromatic ions (and radicals) is studied, using a model in which the total energy is regarded as due to that of the original neutral molecule (or charged radical) for which no such effect arises, together with the energy of the odd electron in the degenerate orbital. It is shown that a general formula exists for the potential energy, analogous to, but more general than, that of Moffitt and Liehr. Three configurations of minimum energy, and three saddle-points, exist, and formulae are derived which make possible the calculation of the corresponding energies and bondlength changes. Numerical applications to benzene and triphenylene show excellent agreement with direct full-scale Roothaan-type calculations by Colpa. }
