“Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technology that enables us to track the 3D biodistribution of a molecular contrast agent, known as a ‘tracer,’ giving us a non-invasive imaging assay of the molecular pathways of patient disease; this disease biology/biochemistry information is complementary to that provided by anatomical or physiological imaging modalities such as x-ray CT or MRI. 

 In a PET scan, we introduce a radioactive contrast agent into the patient, which is a concentration of biologically-relevant molecules, each labeled with a positron-emitting radionuclide. 

 PET data acquisition comprises the detection of millions of pairs of the oppositely-directed 511 keV photons that result from positron annihilations of the radioactive contrast agent in the patient tissues.  We individually collect those annihilation photon pairs in small (e.g. 4x4x20 mm^3), rod-like scintillation detector elements surrounding the patient, usually configured in a cylindrical geometry, with ~60=70 cm diameter and ~20 cm axial length.  Pairs of detection elements on either side of the cylinder form system response lines along which the oppositely directed annihilation photons are collected. Those coincident hit pairs are each processed to measure photon interaction location, energy, and arrival time for each annihilation photon event. 

 To create the 3D bio distribution of the radio tracer from the pairs of hits recorded along the system response lines, PET uses an iterative statistical tomographic image reconstruction algorithm that solves the inverse problem mapping those hits into the most likely 3D tracer bio distribution that would have created that pattern of hits in the detection elements. This image reconstruction algorithm involves successive iterations of line projection operations (back projection / forward projection) that spread the the event probability along those system response lines.

  In time-of-flight (TOF) PET,  if the arrival time difference measured between the two annihilation photons along each response line (a,k.a. coincidence time resolution or CTR) is very precise, it can be employed to more precisely and accurately localize the line projection operations; since more annihilation events are positioned closer to their true origin along each response line (delta X = c*CTR/2) (e.g. within a 3.4 cm segment along each line for a TOF-PET system CTR of 225 ps FWHM), this improves the reconstructed image signal-to-noise radio (SNR), yielding better quality and accuracy of the reconstructed images. This TOF-PET signal amplification improves as 1/sqrt(CTR). This enhancement can be exploited in a number of important ways such as enhancing lesion detection, or to lower injected radioactivity dose and/or patient scanning time. 

  The most state of the art TOF-PET system in the market achieves ~225 ps CTR, which constrains events to be within a 3.4 cm segment along each response line during image reconstruction.  If successful, this project would yield a novel annihilation photon detection method that yields <10 ps CTR, constraining the event to within a 1.5 mm region along each line.  Thus, since this is smaller than typical reconstructed image voxels used in PET, with 10 ps CTR TOF-PET, image reconstruction line projection operations would not be required anymore, and each event would be placed accurately and precisely at their origin along response lines based on this very precisely measured time difference between photons."
