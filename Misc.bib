Removal of the potassium 4s valence electron increases the binding energies of both the valence and the 1s core levels, and induces an ultrafast change of the 1s-4p x-ray transition energy by about 2.8  eV. We simultaneously observe a 50\% increase in oscillator strength of K+ over K0 for that transition."

abstract = "{Ab initio configurational interaction calculations of electronic states of the doubly charged cation N$_2^{2+}$ are presented and the results used to calculate the energies and predissociation lifetimes of all $(\nu, J)$ levels of the quasi-bound states. A comprehensive analysis of known experimental and theoretical data has been carried out with discussion of the sources of error and complexity of the problems. From a theoretical standpoint, relative energies of the lower states of each symmetry are believed to be accurate to within 0.1-0.2 eV, though results for some of the higher states may be far less reliable. The problem is greatly complicated by mixing of states of radically different character, such as occur when bound charge-polarization states correlating with N$^{2+}$ plus N cross those describing essentially Coulombic repulsion curves. It was thus not possible to obtain reliable results at internuclear separations greater than about 3-4 \AA. Notwithstanding deficiencies in both experiment and theory, it is shown that a consistent interpretation is possible within quoted accuracies of experimental data from appearance energies of N$_2{2+}$, Auger spectra, double-charge-transfer spectroscopy, high-resolution optical spectroscopy, and kinetic energy release associated with predissociation on a broad range of time scales.}"

A two-step multiphonon model, based on ionization of $N_2$ through vertical transitions and spontaneous dissociation of $N_2^{+2} (Z \geq 2)$ via Coulomb and non-Coulombic potentials curves, is presented to explain the origin of the kinetic energies of atomic ions observed. The model predicts that dissociation occurs near the internuclear separation of the neutral, charge-asymmetric dissociation channels are important, and dissociation via Coulomb curves will only be observed for pulses with extremely short rise times."

%abstract = "We present a method of adjusting the pulse duration and eliminating the pulse-front tilt of an ultrashort pulse in real time by use of a specially configured single-shot autocorrelator. Pulse-front tilt, or a temporal delay across the pulse front, is a common ultrashort-pulse phenomenon when dispersive elements are being used. We show the design of an autocorrelator that can be used to eliminate the pulse-front tilt and simultaneously adjust the pulse duration in real time by adjustment of the pulse compressor of a chirped-pulse amplified laser system."
