%abstract  ="Semi-classical simulations of the UV-photoabsorption cross sections of adenine{,} guanine{,} cytosine{,} thymine{,} and uracil in gas phase were performed at the resolution-of-identity coupled cluster to the second-order (RI-CC2) level. With the exception of cytosine{,} the spectra of the other four nucleobases show a two band pattern separated by a low intensity region. The spectrum of cytosine is shaped by a sequence of three bands of increasing intensity. The first band of guanine is composed by two [small pi][small pi]* transitions of similar intensities. The analysis of individual contributions to the spectra allows a detailed assignment of bands. It is shown that the semi-classical simulations are able to predict general features of the experimental spectra{,} including their absolute intensities."}

%abstract ={A comprehensive effort in photodynamical ab initio simulations of the ultrafast deactivation pathways for all five nucleobases adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil is reported. These simulations are based on a complete nonadiabatic surface-hopping approach using extended multiconfigurational wave functions. Even though all five nucleobases share the basic internal conversion mechanisms, the calculations show a distinct grouping into purine and pyrimidine bases as concerns the complexity of the photodynamics. The purine bases adenine and guanine represent the most simple photodeactivation mechanism with the dynamics leading along a diabatic ππ* path directly and without barrier to the conical intersection seam with the ground state. In the case of the pyrimidine bases, the dynamics starts off in much flatter regions of the ππ* energy surface due to coupling of several states. This fact prohibits a clear formation of a single reaction path. Thus, the photodynamics of the pyrimidine bases is much richer and includes also nπ* states with varying importance, depending on the actual nucleobase considered. Trapping in local minima may occur and, therefore, the deactivation time to the ground state is also much longer in these cases. Implications of these findings are discussed (i) for identifying structural possibilities where singlet/triplet transitions can occur because of sufficient retention time during the singlet dynamics and (ii) concerning the flexibility of finding other deactivation pathways in substituted pyrimidines serving as candidates for alternative nucleobases.},
