	abstract = {Attosecond metrology has so far largely remained limited to titanium:sapphire lasers combined with an active stabilization of the carrier-envelope phase (CEP). These sources limit the achievable photon energy to \&\#x0223C;100 eV which is too low to access X-ray absorption edges of most second- and third-row elements which are central to chemistry, biology and material science. Therefore, intense efforts are underway to extend attosecond metrology to the soft-X-ray (SXR) domain using mid-infrared (mid-IR) drivers. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a method that solves the long-standing problem of the complete temporal characterization of ultra-broadband (\&\#x0226B;10 eV) attosecond pulses. We generalize the recently proposed Volkov-transform generalized projection algorithm (VTGPA) to the case of multiple overlapping photoelectron spectra and demonstrate its application to isolated attosecond pulses. This new approach overcomes all key limitations of previous attosecond-pulse reconstruction methods, in particular the central-momentum approximation (CMA), and it incorporates the physical, complex-valued and energy-dependent photoionization matrix elements. These properties make our approach general and particularly suitable for attosecond supercontinua of arbitrary bandwidth. We apply this method to attosecond SXR pulses generated from a two-cycle mid-IR driver, covering a bandwidth of \&\#x0223C;100 eV and reaching photon energies up to 180 eV. We extract an SXR pulse duration of (43\&\#x000B1;1) as from our streaking measurements, defining a new world record. Our results prove that the popular and broadly available scheme of post-compressing the output of white-light-seeded optical parametric amplifiers is adequate to produce high-contrast isolated attosecond pulses covering the L-edges of silicon, phosphorous and sulfur. Our new reconstruction method and experimental results open the path to the production and characterization of attosecond pulses lasting less than one atomic unit of time (24 as) and covering X-ray absorption edges of most light elements.},

	abstract = {Attosecond streaking is a powerful tool to investigate ultrafast electron dynamics on the attosecond time scale. To obtain the highest temporal resolution in a pump-probe experiment, soft-X-ray (SXR) and infrared (IR) pulses have to be carefully characterized. Here, we present a detailed description of our recent generalization of the Volkov-transform generalized projection algorithm (VTGPA) and its application to multiple overlapping photoelectron bands. This method allows for the complete temporal reconstruction of both IR and SXR pulses under the inclusion of accurate complex photoionization matrix elements (PMEs). In this article, we compare the performance of our new method with traditional algorithms. We particularly focus on the important role played by the photoelectron angular distribution (PAD) which needs to be taken into account for the highest fidelity of attosecond pulse reconstruction. For this purpose, we investigate numerically the influence of the finite collection angle of the electron spectrometer on the retrieval and the obtained pulse parameters. We further theoretically demonstrate the reliability of the reconstruction for pulse durations even shorter than the atomic unit of time.},

Here, we report the realization of TR-XAS with a temporal resolution in the low femtosecond range by developing a table-top high-harmonic source reaching up to 350 eV, thus partially covering the spectral region of 280 to 530 eV, where water is transmissive. We use this source to follow previously unexamined light-induced chemical reactions in the lowest electronic states of isolated CF4+ and SF6+ molecules in the gas phase. By probing element-specific core-to-valence transitions at the carbon K-edge or the sulfur L-edges, we characterize their reaction paths and observe the effect of symmetry breaking through the splitting of absorption bands and Rydberg-valence mixing induced by the geometry changes.},

From the calculated electron spectra, we show how to retrieve the duration and the chirp of the attosecond pulse using genetic algorithm. The method is expected to be used for characterizing the attosecond pulses which are produced by polarization gating of few-cycle left- and right-circularly polarized infrared laser pulses.},
