%abstract = {We demonstrate two-dimensional ultrafast fourier transform spectroscopy in the deep ultraviolet (~ 260 nm) using an acousto-optic modulator based pulse shaper. The use of a pulse shaper in the ultraviolet allows for rapid scanning, high phase (time) stability (~ 0.017 rad) and phase cycling. We present measurements on the DNA nucleobase Adenine.}

%In conclusion, we have demonstrated 2D Fourier transform spectroscopy in the deep ultraviolet
using an AOM based ultrafast laser pulse shaper. The technique is ideally suited for study-
ing the excited state dynamics of the many molecules whose S0-S1 transition lies in the deep
ultraviolet. By using a UV pulse shaper to perform the measurements, we naturally have ex-
cellent phase (time) stability and can perform rapid phase cycling, enhancing the data quality
and isolating desired nonlinear polarizations in the 2D spectrum.

%abstract = {By use of the recently developed technique of guided-wave frequency conversion, the generation of sub-10-fs light pulses in the UV has been demonstrated for what is believed to be the first time. Cross-phase modulation of the light in a hollow waveguide produced a bandwidth of 16nm, with a center frequency of 270 nm, at 1 kHz. A simple grating pair was used to compress the pulses to a duration of 8 fs, as measured by self-diffraction frequency-resolved optical gating. In the experiment the compressed energy was greater than 1 $\mu$J , with a peak power of \&gt;100 MW ; the technique can be scaled to higher energy. Further improvements should make it possible to generate pulses as short as ~3 fs with this technique.},

%abstract = "Absorption cross-sections of the monomer and dimer of formic acid vapor at 302 K have been determined at 1 nm intervals from 195 to 250 nm by non-linear least-squares analysis of the per cent transmission of 29 pressures of formic acid at each wavelength. The observed blue shift of the absorption maximum of the dimer with respect to the monomer and the lack of vibrational structure in the spectrum of the dimer are discussed in terms of the effect of hydrogen bonding on n-Ï€* transitions.

%abstract = {We demonstrate that nonlinear frequency upconversion of few-cycle near-infrared (NIR) laser pulses, by means of harmonic generation in noble gases, is a promising approach for extending cutting-edge, few-cycle ultrafast technology into the deep ultraviolet and beyond, without the needfor UV dispersion control. In our experiment, we generate 3.7-fs pulses inthe deep UV (~4.6 eV) with adjustable polarization and gigawatt-scale  peak power. We demonstrate that the implementation of this concept with a quasi-monocycle driver offers the potential for advancing UV pulsegeneration towards the 1-fs frontier.}

We further demonstrate the utility of these pulses for producing high-order harmonic continua of unprecedented bandwidth at photon energies around 100 eV. Ultra-broadband coherent continua extending from 90 eV to more than 130 eV with smooth spectral intensity distributions that exhibit dramatic, never-before-observed sensitivity to the carrier-envelope offset (CEO) phase of the driver laser pulse were generated. These results suggest the feasibility of sub-100-attosecond XUV pulse generation for attosecond spectroscopy in the 100 eV range, and of a simple yet highly sensitive on-line CEO phase detector with sub-50-ms response time.}
