abstract={The authors have considered the problem of adiabatic rapid passage (ARP) in a dressed atom formalism. They find that the conditions for ARP can be understood as conditions for minimising the probability of dressed atomic state transitions, and that these probabilities can be used to obtain an estimate of the degree of population reversal. Furthermore, by considering ARP in the dressed atom formalism the similarity between ARP and the Landau-Zener non-adiabatic transition problem is made quite apparent.}
