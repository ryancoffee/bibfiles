abstract = {A new energy and angular electron analyzer ArTOF (Angular Resolved Time of Flight) is described. The analyzer is based on simultaneous measurement of flight times and angles in an advanced electron lens system. In angular modes the new analyzer combines an increase in transmission by almost three orders of magnitude with improved resolution, in comparison to standard state-of-the-art electron spectrometers. In this report we describe some design principles and we give a review of calibration and alignment procedures necessary for the use of the ArTOF on a synchrotron radiation facility. Our program scripts to handle the large datasets are also discussed. Furthermore we give a broad description of the new research fields that benefit from the use of the ArTOF and give a short summary of the first results of angle resolved photoemission measurement with ArTOF using the single-bunch X-ray pulses from the BESSY II storage ring facility.}

abstract = {The construction of a new electron energy analyzer for photoelectron spectroscopy is described. The analyzer is a full hemisphere with a mean radius of 200mm. The spectrometer incorporates highly stable voltage supplies and is equipped with a multidetection system. The electron lens can be operated in different modes, optimizing transmission, spatial resolution or angular resolution. An angular resolution of better than 0.2° can be obtained. UV excited Xe5p spectra recorded in the gas phase show that the energy resolution is better than 2.7 meV at 2eV analyzer pass energy.}
