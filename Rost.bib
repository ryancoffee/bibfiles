abstract  ="We have constructed deep neural networks{,} which can map fluctuating photo-electron spectra obtained from noisy pulses to spectra from noise-free pulses. The network is trained on spectra from noisy pulses in combination with random Hamilton matrices{,} representing systems which could exist but do not necessarily exist. In [Giri et al.{,} Phys. Rev. Lett.{,} 2020{,} 124{,} 113201] we performed a purification of fluctuating spectra{,} that is{,} mapping them to those from Fourier-limited Gaussian pulses. Here{,} we investigate the performance of such neural-network-based maps for predicting spectra of double pulses{,} pulses with a chirp and even partially-coherent pulses from fluctuating spectra generated by noisy pulses. Secondly{,} we demonstrate that along with purification of a fluctuating double-pulse spectrum{,} one can estimate the time-delay of the underlying double pulse{,} an attractive feature for single-shot spectra from SASE FELs. We demonstrate our approach with resonant two-photon ionization{,} a non-linear process{,} sensitive to details of the laser pulse."}
