%abstract ={The Criegee intermediates are carbonyl oxides postulated to play key roles in the reactions of ozone with unsaturated hydrocarbons; these reactions constitute an important mechanism for the removal of unsaturated hydrocarbons and for the production of OH in the atmosphere. Here, we report the transient infrared (IR) absorption spectrum of the simplest Criegee intermediate CH2OO, produced from CH2I + O2 in a flow reactor, using a step-scan Fourier-transform spectrometer. The five observed bands provide definitive identification of this intermediate. The observed vibrational frequencies are more consistent with a zwitterion rather than a diradical structure of CH2OO. The direct IR detection of CH2OO should prove useful for kinetic and mechanistic investigations of the Criegee mechanism.},

%abstract  ="SO2 scavenging and self-reaction of CH2OO were utilized for the decay of CH2OO to extract the absorption spectrum of CH2OO under bulk conditions. Absolute absorption cross sections of CH2OO at 308.4 and 351.8 nm were obtained from laser-depletion measurements in a jet-cooled molecular beam. The peak cross section is (1.23 +/- 0.18) [times] 10-17 cm2 at 340 nm."}
