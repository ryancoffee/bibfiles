The Stanford Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) located at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory in Menlo Park, California, began operation in the Fall of 2009. The LCLS is a true x-ray laser, approximately one billion times brighter than any previous laboratory source of x-ray radiation. Here we review some of the first atomic, molecular, and optical experiments that probe the fundamental interactions of such uniquely bright and short x-ray pulses with atoms and molecules, summarize some of the theory leading up to these experiments and conclude with some ideas on future avenues of investigation."

abstract = {We present a new technique for measuring the relative delay between a soft x-ray FEL pulse and an optical laser that indicates a sub 25 fs RMS measurement error. An ultra-short x-ray pulse photo-ionizes a semiconductor (Si3N4) membrane and changes the optical transmission. An optical continuum pulse with a temporally chirped bandwidth spanning 630 nm -- 710 nm interacts with the membrane such that the timing of the x-ray pulse can be determined from the onset of the spectral modulation of the transmitted optical pulse. This experiment demonstrates a nearly in situ single-shot measurement of the x-ray pulse arrival time relative to the ultra-short optical pulse.},

Our measured alignment shows an improvement over previous one-pulse or two-pulse experimental alignment results and approaches the theoretical maximum value. We employ eight equally spaced ultrafast laser pulses with a separation that takes advantage of the periodic revivals for the ensemble of quantum rotors. Each successive pulse increases the transient alignment [<$\cos^2 \theta$>(t)] and also moves the rotational population away from thermal equilibrium. These measurements are combined with simulations to determine the value of <$\cos^2 \theta$>, the J-state distributions, and the functional dependencies of the alignment features.}"

%abstract = "{Using pump-probe spectroscopy with ultrashort laser pulses, we see an enhancement of the charge-asymmetric dissociation (CAD) channel, $I_2^{2+}\rightarrow I^{2+) + I$, over a narrow range of internuclear separation, in addition to the previously studied enhanced ionization of this species. 
%The enhancement of the CAD channel appears to come from excitation of the symmetric ground state dissociation channel $(I^+ + I^+)$ for two reasons: there is a depletion in the symmetric channel at approximately the same pump-probe delay as the asymmetric enhancement, and the symmetric channel decreases while the asymmetric channel increases as a function of probe intensity at a fixed delay.
%In addition, we find that the kinetic energies of the of the extra I2+ + I ions decrease for increasing delay.
%A more complete understanding of these observations depends strongly on the little known potential energy curves of the various charge states of $I_2$. Thus, we use model potential curves to explain the delay dependence of the kinetic energy release. The excitation appears to be produced by a resonant 3-photon transition within I$_2^{2+}$ rather than by ionization of I$_2^+$.}"
