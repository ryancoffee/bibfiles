%abstract ={Photodissociation of carbon dioxide (CO2) has long been assumed to proceed exclusively to carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen atom (O) primary products. However, recent theoretical calculations suggested that an exit channel to produce C + O2 should also be energetically accessible. Here we report the direct experimental evidence for the C + O2 channel in CO2 photodissociation near the energetic threshold of the C(3P) + O2(X3Σg–) channel with a yield of 5 ± 2% using vacuum ultraviolet laser pump-probe spectroscopy and velocity-map imaging detection of the C(3PJ) product between 101.5 and 107.2 nanometers. Our results may have implications for nonbiological oxygen production in CO2-heavy atmospheres.},

%abstract = "Spectrally resolved \{UV\} absorption cross-sections between 190 and 320 nm were measured in shock-heated \{CO2\} between 880 and 3050 K and \{H2O\} between 1230 and 2860 K. Absorption spectra were acquired with 10&#xa0;μs time resolution using a unique kinetic spectrograph, thereby enabling comparisons with time-dependent chemical kinetic modeling of post-shock thermal decomposition and chemical reactions. Although room temperature \{CO2\} is transparent (σ&lt;10−22&#xa0;cm2) at wavelengths longer than 200 nm, hot \{CO2\} has significant absorption (σ&gt;10−20&#xa0;cm2) extending to wavelengths longer than 300 nm. The temperature dependence of \{CO2\} absorption strongly suggests sharply increased transition probabilities from excited vibrational levels. "
