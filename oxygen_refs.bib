  abstract={We report the first measurement of the kinetic energy release distributions of multiply charged oxygen ions produced in collisions of O 2 molecules with 5.9 MeV/amu Xe 18+ and Xe 43+ ions. The slow O q + ions generated in the collision are detected in coincidence by a time- and position sensitive multi- particle detector. An analysis of correlated momenta of molecular fragments provides the kinetic energy release distribution for various reaction pairs O 2 → O q 1 +O q 2+ with a total charge up to q = q 1 + q 2 = 11. The position of the maximum and the width of the distributions are well described by the recently suggested Average Bunch Statistical (ABS) model.}

The oxygen ion kinetic energy spectrum was recorded by inverting the relevant potentials of an electron spectrometer for the detection of positive particles. The 4 Sigma - and 2 Sigma - O 1s initial core hole states have been studied using monochromatised X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Potential energy curves for a number of electronic states of the O 2 2+ dication have been calculated with the complete active space SCF (CASSCF) and multireference contracted CI (MRCCI) methods with a one-particle basis set of medium size ((8s, 6p, 2d)). An analysis of the O 2 Auger electron spectrum based on the computed potential curves of O 2 2+ is presented. The autoionisation satellites are analysed and these lines correspond to molecular singly ionised final states. One line at 510.7 eV, however, is associated with an atomic-like transition. Two shake-up Auger satellites are identified by a comparison with a recent O 1s shake-up spectrum from O 2 .}

Potential energy curves of the ground state, the core-ionized states and the doubly charged final states are calculated and Auger decay rates are obtained with the one-centre approximation. Using the lifetime vibrational interference method, band shapes are obtained for all contributions to the Auger spectrum. The calculated Auger electron spectrum allows us to identify all features observed experimentally. Significant differences to previous assignments are reported. A quantitative simulation of the spectrum is given on the basis of a curve-fitting procedure, in which the energetic positions and intensities of the theoretical bands were optimized. Besides providing a basis for a refined analysis of the spectrum, the fit allows us to assess the accuracy of the calculation. As expected for this level of theory, the absolute accuracy of the valence CI energies is found to be about 0.3 eV. The inherent error of the one-centre transition rates is less than 5% of the most intense transition in the spectrum. The frequently questioned one-centre Auger transition rates are shown to be rather appropriate if applied with reasonable wavefunctions and if the vibrational band structure of the molecular spectrum is properly taken into account.}

# abstract: Resonant soft x-ray emission spectroscopy has been applied to study the issue of symmetry breaking upon core-hole excitation in molecular oxygen. The results provide direct evidence that the inversion symmetry is not broken in the core-excited states. Furthermore, the experiments themselves demonstrate a new experimental technique of broad applicability for studies of electronic structure and excitation dynamics in free atoms and molecules.

# This is Adachi where we see the benefit of angle resolved ion yields.  The requirement for memory of molecular orientation is still required since they use a KER filter to take only fragments that make up the axial recoil... maybe our way is better.

#  abstract={Formation of fluorescing and metastable fragments from photon-induced dissociation of O 2 has been investigated in the 20.2–21.2 eV and 22.5–25.0 eV photon energy regions under high resolution. The neutral particles are detected using a microchannel plate stack, where electric potentials prevent charged particles from reaching the detector. Yield curves of excited neutral particles exhibit peaks at Rydberg states converging to O 2 +(B 2 Σ g − ) and O 2 +(c 4 Σ u − ). Furthermore, these yields are strongly enhanced at high- n , enabling the measurement of their energy location and width. A simple model for the decay of the Rydberg states converging to O 2 +(c 4 Σ u − ) based on the competition between autoionization and neutral dissociation is used to describe qualitatively the observed spectrum. The results indicate that the lifetime of the O 2 +(c 4 Σ u − ) v = 0 level is two orders of magnitude longer than that of the O 2 +(c 4 Σ u − ) v = 1 level.}
