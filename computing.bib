 abstract = {Computational properties of use to biological organisms or to the construction of computers can emerge as collective properties of systems having a large number of simple equivalent components (or neurons). The physical meaning of content-addressable memory is described by an appropriate phase space flow of the state of a system. A model of such a system is given, based on aspects of neurobiology but readily adapted to integrated circuits. The collective properties of this model produce a content-addressable memory which correctly yields an entire memory from any subpart of sufficient size. The algorithm for the time evolution of the state of the system is based on asynchronous parallel processing. Additional emergent collective properties include some capacity for generalization, familiarity recognition, categorization, error correction, and time sequence retention. The collective properties are only weakly sensitive to details of the modeling or the failure of individual devices.},

abstract = {This paper outlines a relaxation approach using the Hopfield neural network for solving the global stereovision matching problem. The primitives used are edge segments. The similarity, smoothness and uniqueness constraints are transformed into the form of an energy function whose minimum value corresponds to the best solution of the problem. We combine two methods: (a) optimization/relaxation[1]and (b) relaxation merit[2]with the above three constraints mapped in an energy function. The main contribution is made (1) by applying a learning strategy in the similarity constraint and (2) by introducing specific conditions to overcome the violation of the smoothness constraint and to avoid the serious problem arising from the required fixation of a disparity limit. So, we improve the stereovision matching process. A better performance of the proposed method is illustrated with a comparative analysis against a classical relaxation method.}

	abstract={We address the image denoising problem, where zero-mean white and homogeneous Gaussian additive noise is to be removed from a given image. The approach taken is based on sparse and redundant representations over trained dictionaries. Using the K-SVD algorithm, we obtain a dictionary that describes the image content effectively. Two training options are considered: using the corrupted image itself, or training on a corpus of high-quality image database. Since the K-SVD is limited in handling small image patches, we extend its deployment to arbitrary image sizes by defining a global image prior that forces sparsity over patches in every location in the image. We show how such Bayesian treatment leads to a simple and effective denoising algorithm. This leads to a state-of-the-art denoising performance, equivalent and sometimes surpassing recently published leading alternative denoising methods},
