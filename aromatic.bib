	abstract="The IR spectra of gaseous nitrobenzene (NB) and its 15N isotopomer have been obtained in the frequency range of 3500--250 cm−1, and the far-IR spectra of their solutions and the NB neat liquid sample have been recorded in the range of 600--30 cm−1. A detailed description of the spectra of NB and 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (sym-TNB) and their isotopomers has been accomplished using the force fields calculated at the MP2(full)/aug-cc-pVTZ and MP2(full)/cc-pVTZ levels. Transferability of the refined scale factors for the calculated force constants obtained by the Pulay technique has been used to provide evidence for validity of both interpreting the NB and sym-TNB spectra and refining the calculated force fields. The direct and inverse spectral problems have been solved by variational technique to determine torsional energy levels and refine the potential function by optimizing the Vk coefficients in its Fourier series expansion. The height of the MP2(full) barrier to internal rotation has been reduced from 5.5 to 4.5 kcal/mol due to extension of the used basis set from 6-31(d,p) to aug-cc-pVTZ. The method of joint dynamic structural analysis of the GED, MW, and vibrational spectroscopy, and ab initio data in terms of the PES parameters have been applied to investigation of equilibrium geometry and internal rotation in the nonrigid NB and sym-TNB molecules having one and three coupled internal rotors, respectively. The experimental re-parameter values of both molecules (C2v and D3h point group symmetries) are in agreement with those obtained by ab initio calculations. This paper is dedicated to Professor Magdolna Hargittai on the occasion of her 70th birthday.",

	abstract = {Nitro compounds release NO, NO2, and other species, but neither the structures during the reactions nor the time scales are known. Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) allowed the study of the NO release from nitrobenzene, and the molecular pathways and the structures of the transient species were identified. It was observed, in contrast to previous inferences, that nitric oxide and phenoxyl radicals are formed dominantly and that the time scale of formation is 8.8±2.2 ps. The structure of the phenoxyl radical was determined for the first time, and found to be quinoid-like. The mechanism proposed involves a repulsive triplet state, following intramolecular rearrangement. This efficient generation of NO may have important implications for the control of by-products in drug delivery and other applications.},
