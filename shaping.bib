Numerical results show that, depending on the coupling length and coupling coefficient, one can achieve very different temporal shapes at the output of the directional couplers. For instance, temporal re-shaping of Gaussian-like pulses into Hermite-Gaussian pulses, parabolic pulses, square temporal waveforms and sequences of equalized multiple pulses with time widths down to the femtosecond range can be achieved using readily feasible fiber/waveguide designs. The detrimental influence of the second-order variation of the detuning factor in these pulse shapers is also numerically investigated.},

In OPA realized by three-wave mixing, injection of all three waves into the same mode with appropriate phase relationship results in amplification of the signal phase, with an associated deamplification of the signal energy. Prospects for the use of this technique in the temporal domain for shaping ultrashort laser pulses are analyzed using a numerical model. Several representative pulse shaping capabilities of this technique are identified, which can significantly augment the performance of common passive pulse shaping methods operating in the Fourier domain. It is found that the use of phase-sensitive OPA shows a potential for significant compression of ~ 100 fs pulses, steepening of the rise time of ultrashort pulses, and production of pulse doublets and pulse trains. It is also shown that the group velocity mismatch can assist the shaping process. Such pulse shaping capabilities are found to be within reach of this technique in common nonlinear optical crystals pumped by pulses available from compact femtosecond chirped-pulse amplification laser systems.},

Femtosecond CARS can be implemented in a collinear pump/probe beam configuration for microspectroscopy applications and has emerged as a powerful technique for chemical imaging of biological specimens. However, one serious limitation of this approach is the presence of a high nonresonant background component that often obscures the resonant signals of interest. We report here an innovative pulse-shaping method based on Lorentzian amplitude and phase spectral modulation of a broadband femtosecond probe pulse that yields spectra with both high spectral resolution and no nonresonant background. No further mathematical analysis is needed to extract Raman spectra. The utility of the proposed method for CARS microscopy is demonstrated using a mixture of polystyrene and latex beads, as well as dry-fixed embryonic stem cells.},

abstract = {In this Letter, we present a scanner and digital micromirror device (DMD)-based ultrafast pulse shaper, i.e., S-DUPS, for programmable ultrafast pulse modulation, achieving a shaping rate of 2\&\#xA0;MHz. To our knowledge, the S-DUPS is the fastest programmable pulse shaper reported to date. In the S-DUPS, the frequency spectrum of the input pulsed laser is first spread horizontally, and then mapped to a thin stripe on the DMD programmed with phase modulation patterns. A galvanometric scanner, synchronized with the DMD, subsequently scans the spectrum vertically on the DMD to achieve a shaping rate up to 10\&\#xA0;s MHz. A grating pair and a cylindrical lens in front of the DMD compensate for the temporal and spatial dispersion of the system. To verify the concept, experiments were conducted with the DMD and the galvanometric scanner operated at 2\&\#xA0;kHz and 1\&\#xA0;kHz, respectively, achieving a 2\&\#xA0;MHz speed for continuous group velocity dispersion tuning, as well as 2\% efficiency. Up to 5\% efficiency of S-DUPS can be expected with high efficiency gratings and optical components of proper coatings.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that pulse shaping of a broadband Ti:sapphire laser can result in almost an order of magnitude increase in the sensitivity and signal to background ratio (SBR) of multiphoton total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. We produced transform-limited pulses of 15 fs duration at the sample, and observed a 8-fold enhancement in the fluorescence of CdSe/ZnS quantum dots via two-photon objective-type TIRF excitation. There was a concomitant 6-fold increase of the SBR upon compression of the pulse duration. Enhancement of non-linear evanescent imaging has recently been demonstrated using surface-plasmons \[Opt. Express 17, 5987 (2009)\] and structured substrates \[Opt. Express 18, 23218 (2010)\]. Our approach of ultrafast pulse shaping could be used alone or combined with these new methods to offer significant gains in image quality.},
