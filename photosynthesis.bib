%abstract  ="Photosynthetic organisms are capable of harvesting solar energy with near unity quantum efficiency. Even more impressively{,} this efficiency can be regulated in response to the demands of photosynthetic reactions and the fluctuating light-levels of natural environments. We discuss the distinctive design principles through which photosynthetic light-harvesting functions. These emergent properties of photosynthesis appear both within individual pigment-protein complexes and in how these complexes integrate to produce a functional{,} regulated apparatus that drives downstream photochemistry. One important property is how the strong interactions and resultant quantum coherence{,} produced by the dense packing of photosynthetic pigments{,} provide a tool to optimize for ultrafast{,} directed energy transfer. We also describe how excess energy is quenched to prevent photodamage under high-light conditions{,} which we investigate through theory and experiment. We conclude with comments on the potential of using these features to improve solar energy devices."

%    abstract = { Recent research suggests that electronic energy transfer in complex biological and chemical systems can involve quantum coherence, even at ambient temperature conditions. It is particularly notable that this phenomenon has been found in some photosynthetic proteins. The role of these proteins in photosynthesis is introduced. The meaning of quantum-coherent energy transfer is explained, and it is compared to FÃ¶rster energy transfer. Broad, interdisciplinary questions for future work are noted. For example, how can chemists use quantum coherence in synthetic systems (perhaps in organic photovoltaics)? Why did certain photosynthetic organisms evolve to use quantum coherence in light harvesting? Are these electronic excitations entangled? }

%abstract ={The design principles that support persistent electronic coherence in biological light-harvesting systems are obscured by the complexity of such systems. Some electronic coherences in these systems survive for hundreds of femtoseconds at physiological temperatures, suggesting that coherent dynamics may play a role in photosynthetic energy transfer. Coherent effects may increase energy transfer efficiency relative to strictly incoherent transfer mechanisms. Simple, tractable, manipulable model systems are required in order to probe the fundamental physics underlying these persistent electronic coherences, but to date, these quantum effects have not been observed in small molecules. We have engineered a series of rigid synthetic heterodimers that can serve as such a model system and observed quantum beating signals in their two-dimensional electronic spectra consistent with the presence of persistent electronic coherences.},
