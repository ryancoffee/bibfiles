abstract = {Abstract This study investigated the impact of information communication technology (ICT) and economic growth (GDP) on electricity consumption (EC) for a global panel consisting of 67 countries using a dynamic panel data model. We also implement these empirical models for three income panels, namely, high income, middle income, and low income panels. The panel model was used in this study from the period 1990–2012. Our main findings show a positive and statistically significant effect of ICT on electricity consumption when ICT measured using Internet connections and mobile phones. Moreover, the results indicate that economic growth has a positive and statistical significant effect on electricity consumption for four global panels. Financial development is found to have a positive impact on electricity consumption in global panels, middle income, and low income panels. For the high income and middle income, the population has a positive and statistical significant effect on electricity consumption.},
