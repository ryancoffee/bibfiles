	abstract = {An electron beam can be made to interact with an undulator magnet so that a collective unstable mode is excited. In this mode, the beam generates coherent radiation whose wavelength is determined by the undulator period and the electron energy. By proper choice of the electron-beam energy, energy dispersion, and density, one can obtain coherent radiation in the soft-x-ray region with peak and average power of the order of hundreds of megawatts and hundreds of milliwatts, respectively. Larger peak powers, of the order of a gigawatt, can be expected for UV radiation with $\lambda$ in the range of 500--2000 {\AA}. We discuss the physical principles of these systems and give examples of how they might be built.},

	abstract = "X-ray free-electron lasers, with pulse durations ranging from a few to several hundred femtoseconds, are uniquely suited for studying atomic, molecular, chemical and biological systems. Characterizing the temporal profiles of these femtosecond X-ray pulses that vary from shot to shot is not only challenging but also important for data interpretation. Here we report the time-resolved measurements of X-ray free-electron lasers by using an X-band radiofrequency transverse deflector at the Linac Coherent Light Source. We demonstrate this method to be a simple, non-invasive technique with a large dynamic range for single-shot electron and X-ray temporal characterization. A resolution of less than 1 fs root mean square has been achieved for soft X-ray pulses. The lasing evolution along the undulator has been studied with the electron trapping being observed as the X-ray peak power approaches 100 GW."

        abstract = {In condensed matter systems, strong optical excitations can induce phonon-driven processes that alter their mechanical properties. We report on a new phenomenon where a massive electronic excitation induces a collective change in the bond character that leads to transient lattice contraction. Single large van der Waals clusters were isochorically heated to a nanoplasma state with an intense 10-fs x-ray (pump) pulse. The structural evolution of the nanoplasma was probed with a second intense x-ray (probe) pulse, showing systematic contraction stemming from electron delocalization during the solid-to-plasma transition. These findings are relevant for any material in extreme conditions ranging from the time evolution of warm or hot dense matter to ultrafast imaging with intense x-ray pulses or, more generally, any situation that involves a condensed matter-to-plasma transition.},
