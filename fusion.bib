abstract = {Plasma disruptions are a serious impediment to tokamak operations, and accordingly there has been a lot of attention given to the topic of predicting disruptions in order to avoid or more effectively mitigate them. While existing prediction goals are based on a combination of engineering constraints and desired operating outcomes, it does not follow that a predictor must meet these strict requirements to offer a benefit. Rather, a cost-based criterion should provide the necessary justification to implement a disruption predictor. A general model for such a cost-based criterion is derived here. This model is used to demonstrate that, with realistic assumptions about the cost of disruptions compared to the cost of unnecessary discharge terminations, existing disruption prediction techniques already meet the minimum criterion to reduce operating costs.}

    abstract = "{We present progress in utilizing a machine learning (ML) assisted optimization framework to study the trends in a parameter space defined by spectrally shaped, high-intensity, petawatt-class (8 J, 45 fs) laser pulses interacting with solid targets and give the first simulation-based overview of predicted trends. A neural network (NN) incorporating uncertainty quantification is trained to predict the number of hot electrons generated by the laser–target interaction as a function of pulse shaping parameters. The predictions of this NN serve as the basis function for a Bayesian optimization framework to navigate this space. For post-experimental evaluation, we compare two separate neural network (NN) models. One is based solely on data from experiments, and the other is trained only on ensemble particle-in-cell simulations. Reviewing the predicted and observed trends across the experiment-capable laser parameter search space, we find that both ML models predict a maximal increase in hot electron generation at a level of approximately 12\%–18\%; however, no statistically significant enhancement was observed in experiments. On direct comparison of the NN models, the average discrepancy is 8.5\%, with a maximum of 30\%. Since shot-to-shot fluctuations in experiments affect the observations, we evaluate the behavior of our optimization framework by performing virtual experiments that vary the number of repeated observations and the noise levels. Here, we discuss the implications of such a framework for future autonomous exploration platforms in high-repetition-rate experiments.}",

abstract={For stable and efficient fusion energy production using a tokamak reactor, it is essential to maintain a high-pressure hydrogenic plasma without plasma disruption. Therefore, it is necessary to actively control the tokamak based on the observed plasma state, to manoeuvre high-pressure plasma while avoiding tearing instability, the leading cause of disruptions. This presents an obstacle-avoidance problem for which artificial intelligence based on reinforcement learning has recently shown remarkable performance. However, the obstacle here, the tearing instability, is difficult to forecast and is highly prone to terminating plasma operations, especially in the ITER baseline scenario. Previously, we developed a multimodal dynamic model that estimates the likelihood of future tearing instability based on signals from multiple diagnostics and actuators5. Here we harness this dynamic model as a training environment for reinforcement-learning artificial intelligence, facilitating automated instability prevention. We demonstrate artificial intelligence control to lower the possibility of disruptive tearing instabilities in DIII-D, the largest magnetic fusion facility in the United States. The controller maintained the tearing likelihood under a given threshold, even under relatively unfavourable conditions of low safety factor and low torque. In particular, it allowed the plasma to actively track the stable path within the time-varying operational space while maintaining H-mode performance, which was challenging with traditional preprogrammed control. This controller paves the path to developing stable high-performance operational scenarios for future use in ITER.},

title = {Thermal runaway criterion as a basis for the protection of high-temperature superconductor magnets},
journal = {Superconductor Science and Technology},
abstract = {High-temperature superconductor (HTS) based high-field magnet systems are essential for particle accelerators and fusion energy applications. Quench protection of such magnets is difficult owing to a slow quench propagation velocity in HTS. While in conventional NbTi and Nb3Sn-based magnets, a normal zone expands typically quickly, and the stored energy is dissipated across a large volume of the windings, a normal zone in an HTS magnet propagates slowly and, thus, can heat up quickly to high temperatures destroying the conductor. At the same time, growing experimental evidence suggests that HTS conductors can operate in a stable dissipative flux flow regime for a substantial range of operational currents before entering an irreversible thermal runaway. Therefore, a new protection paradigm for HTS magnets has emerged, aiming to prevent quenching, using advanced diagnostics to detect the dissipative regime onset. In the present paper, we propose a simple criterion for the thermal runaway in HTS conductors and calculate allowable temperature margins within which an HTS magnet can be operated safely. Outside of those temperature margins, a common quench integral approach may be used to estimate the upper boundary of the time margin for activating the protection system. We verify the applicability of our approach by comparing the calculated runaway conditions for a Bi-2223 conductor with the experimentally measured values. The thermal and time margins can define the quench protection system’s requirements for implementing the quench-avoiding protection paradigm.}

	journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
	abstract = {Modern tokamaks have achieved significant fusion production, but further progress towards steady-state operation has been stymied by a host of kinetic and MHD instabilities. Control and identification of these instabilities is often complicated, warranting the application of data-driven methods to complement and improve physical understanding. In particular, Alfvén eigenmodes are a class of ubiquitous mixed kinetic and MHD instabilities that are important to identify and control because they can lead to loss of confinement and potential damage to the walls of a plasma device. In the present work, we use reservoir computing networks to classify Alfvén eigenmodes in a large labeled database of DIII-D discharges, covering a broad range of operational parameter space. Despite the large parameter space, we show excellent classification and prediction performance, with an average hit rate of 91% and false alarm ratio of 7%, indicating promise for future implementation with additional diagnostic data and consolidation into a real-time control strategy.}
