  abstract = "Time-resolved photoemission with ultrafast pump and probe pulses
              is an emerging technique with wide application potential.
              Real-time recording of nonequilibrium electronic processes,
              transient states in chemical reactions, or the interplay of
              electronic and structural dynamics offers fascinating
              opportunities for future research. Combining valence-band and
              core-level spectroscopy with photoelectron diffraction for
              electronic, chemical, and structural analyses requires few 10 fs
              soft X-ray pulses with some 10 meV spectral resolution, which are
              currently available at high repetition rate free-electron lasers.
              We have constructed and optimized a versatile setup commissioned
              at FLASH/PG2 that combines free-electron laser capabilities
              together with a multidimensional recording scheme for
              photoemission studies. We use a full-field imaging momentum
              microscope with time-of-flight energy recording as the detector
              for mapping of 3D band structures in (k(x), k(y), E) parameter
              space with unprecedented efficiency. Our instrument can image
              full surface Brillouin zones with up to 7 {\AA}(-1) diameter in a
              binding-energy range of several eV, resolving about 2.5 $\times$
              10(5) data voxels simultaneously. Using the ultrafast excited
              state dynamics in the van der Waals semiconductor WSe(2) measured
              at photon energies of 36.5 eV and 109.5 eV, we demonstrate an
              experimental energy resolution of 130 meV, a momentum resolution
              of 0.06 {\AA}(-1), and a system response function of 150 fs.",

abstract = {A new energy and angular electron analyzer ArTOF (Angular Resolved Time of Flight) is described. The analyzer is based on simultaneous measurement of flight times and angles in an advanced electron lens system. In angular modes the new analyzer combines an increase in transmission by almost three orders of magnitude with improved resolution, in comparison to standard state-of-the-art electron spectrometers. In this report we describe some design principles and we give a review of calibration and alignment procedures necessary for the use of the ArTOF on a synchrotron radiation facility. Our program scripts to handle the large datasets are also discussed. Furthermore we give a broad description of the new research fields that benefit from the use of the ArTOF and give a short summary of the first results of angle resolved photoemission measurement with ArTOF using the single-bunch X-ray pulses from the BESSY II storage ring facility.}

abstract = {The construction of a new electron energy analyzer for photoelectron spectroscopy is described. The analyzer is a full hemisphere with a mean radius of 200mm. The spectrometer incorporates highly stable voltage supplies and is equipped with a multidetection system. The electron lens can be operated in different modes, optimizing transmission, spatial resolution or angular resolution. An angular resolution of better than 0.2° can be obtained. UV excited Xe5p spectra recorded in the gas phase show that the energy resolution is better than 2.7 meV at 2eV analyzer pass energy.}
